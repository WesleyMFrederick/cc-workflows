# Git Commits

## Overview

**Mandatory discipline for ALL new git commits.** Every commit MUST follow commit format with a required scope, discovered from codebase structure.

**Core Principle:** Consistent, machine-parsable commit messages enable automated change-log generation, semantic versioning, and clear project history. Commit messages are **names for changes** and follow the same self-contained naming principles as code identifiers.

> [!attention] **The Iron Law**
> NO COMMIT WITHOUT TYPE, SCOPE, DESCRIPTION

This applies to ALL commits: simple fixes, typos, documentation, emergencies - everything. No exceptions.

## When to Use

**MANDATORY:**
- Before creating ANY new git commit
- When Bash tool executes `git commit` command

**OPTIONAL:**
- When revising past commits for consistency

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Bypassing format "just this once"
- Skipping scope because "it doesn't fit"
- Using vague scopes like "misc" or "various"

## Format Structure

### Required Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Supported Types (Extended Common Set)

| Type | Purpose | SemVer Impact |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `feat` | New feature | MINOR |
| `fix` | Bug fix | PATCH |
| `docs` | Documentation only | - |
| `chore` | Maintenance (deps, configs) | - |
| `refactor` | Code restructure, no behavior change | - |
| `test` | Test additions/modifications | - |
| `perf` | Performance improvements | PATCH |
| `ci` | CI/CD pipeline changes | - |
| `build` | Build system changes | - |
| `style` | Code formatting, whitespace | - |

**Breaking Changes:** Include `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer (triggers MAJOR)

## Scope Discovery Process

**THE PRIMARY FAILURE MODE:** Agents abandon entire format when scope is ambiguous. This section prevents that.

### The Mandatory Scope Rule

> [!attention] **Every commit MUST include a scope.**

### How to Discover Scope

1. **Run scope discovery commands:**

   ```bash
   git status
   git diff --name-only
   ```

2. **Identify patterns in changed files:**
   - Top-level directories: `src/`, `docs/`, `tests/`
   - Module names: `auth`, `api`, `ui`, `database`
   - Component names: `LoginForm`, `UserProfile`
   - Package names: `@workspace/package-name`

3. **Apply the Primary Scope Rule:**
   - **Single module:** Use that module name
   - **Multiple modules, one area:** Use area name
   - **Cross-cutting changes:** Pick the PRIMARY changed layer
   - **Truly global:** Use `core`, `config`, or `global`
   - **Can't decide in 30 seconds:** Use top-level directory from first changed file

### Scope Selection Examples

| Changed Files | Correct Scope | Reasoning |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| `src/auth/*.ts` only | `auth` | Single module |
| `docs/README.md` | `readme` | Specific doc file |
| `.github/workflows/*` | `workflows` or `ci` | CI area |
| Multiple test files | `integration` or `unit` | Test type |
| `src/auth/form.tsx`, `src/api/auth.ts`, `src/utils/validate.ts` | `auth` | **Primary** layer is auth, even though utils touched |
| `src/*.ts` (many files, no pattern) | `core` | Global/core changes |

### The 30-Second Rule

**If you can't decide on scope after 30 seconds:**
1. Pick the directory name of the first changed file
2. Or use the most specific layer touched
3. **Never** skip scope because it's ambiguous

**Any scope is better than no scope.** Imperfect scope > abandoned format.

## Description Quality (Self-Contained Naming)

Commit descriptions follow the project's **Self-Contained Naming Principles** - they are names for changes:

### Rules

1. **Descriptive Labels:** The `<type>(<scope>): <description>` format distinguishes operation type, system scope, and outcome
2. **Immediate Understanding:** Anyone should understand what the commit does without reading the diff
3. **Confusion Prevention:** Be specific enough to eliminate ambiguity

### Description Guidelines

- Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Complete the sentence: "This commit will..."
- Be specific: "add" not "update", "fix" not "change"
- Keep under 72 characters
- Lowercase first word (after type)
- No period at end

**Examples:**
- ‚ùå `fix(auth): fix bug` - Too vague
- ‚ùå `fix(auth): update code` - What code? What changed?
- ‚úÖ `fix(auth): prevent null pointer on missing OAuth state`
- ‚úÖ `feat(api): add email validation to login endpoint`

## Footer Management

### Footer Format

One blank line after body (or description if no body), then footers.

### Required Footer Types

**1. AI Coding Assistant Attribution (ALWAYS include):**

```text

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**2. Breaking Changes (when applicable):**

```text
BREAKING CHANGE: description of what broke and migration path
```

**3. Issue/Task References (when applicable):**

```text
Refs: #123
Closes: #456
Fixes: #789
```

**4. Review/Approval Metadata (when applicable):**

```text
Reviewed-by: Name <email>
Approved-by: Name <email>
```

### Footer Assembly Order

1. Breaking changes first (if any)
2. Issue references (if any)
3. Review metadata (if any)
4. Claude attribution (always last)

### Complete Example

```text
feat(auth)!: add OAuth 2.0 support

Replaces legacy session-based auth with OAuth 2.0 flow.
Adds Google and GitHub providers.

BREAKING CHANGE: Session middleware removed, use OAuth tokens

## The Iron Law - Enforcement

> [!attention] ALL NEW COMMITS MUST FOLLOW COMMIT FORMAT

**This applies to:**
- "Simple" commits (typos, formatting)
- "Quick fixes"
- "Just updating a comment"
- Commits under time pressure
- End-of-day commits
- Emergency hotfixes
- Documentation changes
- Configuration changes

**No exceptions. Ever.**

**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**

## Red Flags - STOP Immediately

If you're thinking any of these, STOP and apply the format correctly:

- "This commit is too simple for the format"
- "I'll fix the message in the next commit"
- "The format doesn't add value here"
- "Following the spirit, not the letter"
- "Time pressure makes this exception okay"
- **"Scope doesn't fit / is ambiguous"** ‚Üê Primary failure mode
- "Scope adds minimal value"
- "Can't decide on scope"
- Using vague scopes like "misc", "various", "other"
- Skipping scope entirely
- Vague descriptions like "fix bug" or "update code"

**All of these mean: Stop. Apply the format correctly with a specific scope.**

## Common Rationalizations

These are captured from real baseline testing - agents use these exact rationalizations under pressure:

| Rationalization | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| "Too simple for commit format" | Simple commits still need clear history. Takes 5 seconds. |
| "I'll clean it up later" | Later never comes. Do it now. |
| "Scope doesn't matter for docs" | Docs have structure too. Use appropriate scope (readme, api-docs, guides). |
| "Emergency hotfix, no time" | Hotfixes especially need clear documentation. 10 seconds won't delay deployment. |
| "Following the spirit" | The letter IS the spirit. Format enables tooling and immediate understanding. |
| "Description is obvious from diff" | People read commits without diffs. Make it self-contained. |
| **"Cross-cutting change, scope is arbitrary"** | **Pick the PRIMARY layer. Auth + API + utils? Primary is auth. Use `auth`.** |
| **"Scope adds minimal value"** | **Scopes enable filtering, navigation, and understanding. Mandatory for tooling.** |
| **"Can't decide scope after thinking"** | **Use the 30-Second Rule: pick first file's directory or most specific layer.** |
| "Multiple layers, can't pick one" | **Primary Scope Rule: pick the layer that changed MOST or is MOST important to the feature.** |

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Abandoning Format When Scope Unclear

**Wrong:**

```text
Add email validation to login flow
```

**Right:**

```text
feat(auth): add email validation to login flow
```

**Fix:** Even if scope seems ambiguous (auth? validation? ui?), pick the PRIMARY one. In this case, the primary feature is authentication, so use `auth`.

### Mistake 2: Vague Scope

**Wrong:**

```text
fix(misc): update validation
```

**Right:**

```text
fix(auth): prevent null pointer in email validation
```

**Fix:** "misc" and "various" are red flags. Use the specific module or component.

### Mistake 3: Missing Scope Entirely

**Wrong:**

```text
docs: update README
```

**Right:**

```text
docs(readme): add installation instructions
```

**Fix:** Scopes are MANDATORY. For docs, use the specific doc file or section.

### Mistake 4: Capitalized Description

**Wrong:**

```text
fix(auth): Fix OAuth bug
```

**Right:**

```text
fix(auth): fix OAuth null pointer error
```

**Fix:** Description should be lowercase (except proper nouns).

## Integration with Bash Tool

The Bash tool's git commit workflow references this skill:

**Before creating commit:**

1. Announce: "I'm using the create-git-commit skill to format this commit message."
2. Run scope discovery: `git status` and `git diff --name-only`
3. Select type based on changes
4. Apply Primary Scope Rule to pick scope
5. Craft self-contained description
6. Structure body (optional)
7. Assemble footer in correct order

**Commit message template:**

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[Optional body explaining why]

[Optional: BREAKING CHANGE: details]
[Optional: Refs: #123]
[Optional: Reviewed-by: Name <email>]

## Quick Reference

| Element | Requirement | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Type** | REQUIRED | `feat`, `fix`, `docs` |
| **Scope** | REQUIRED | `auth`, `api`, `readme` |
| **Description** | REQUIRED, lowercase, <72 chars | `add email validation` |
| **Body** | Optional | Explain why, not what |
| **Breaking change** | When applicable | `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer |
| **Issue refs** | When applicable | `Closes: #123` |
| **Attribution** | ALWAYS | Claude Code footer |

## The Bottom Line

> [!attention] **Commit format is a discipline, not a suggestion.**

Like test-driven development, it feels like overhead until you experience the benefits: automated changelogs, semantic versioning, clear history, easy filtering, tool compatibility.

**The scope requirement is non-negotiable** because it's where agents rationalize away the entire format.

When in doubt: Pick a scope in 30 seconds and move on. Any scope > no scope.
