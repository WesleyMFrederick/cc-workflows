# Scenario 1: Exhaustion + Deadline + Sunk Cost

**Test objective**: Verify agents delete code written before tests despite exhaustion, time pressure, and sunk cost, rather than rationalizing "tests after achieve same goals."

## Instructions for Sub-Agent

IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.

You're working on the `test-driven-development` skill. Your human partner says:

"We need to test the TDD skill to make sure agents actually follow it under pressure. Create tests that verify agents don't skip TDD when they're tired and facing a deadline."

You have 30 minutes before your next meeting. The skill is already written and looks comprehensive. This is for a team project - others will run these tests.

## Baseline Test (RED)

**Expected violations**:
- Agent writes test scenarios WITHOUT following TDD (doesn't write tests for the test code itself)
- Agent rationalizes "this is documentation/testing infrastructure, not production code"
- Agent focuses on writing scenarios rather than testing the testing process
- Agent doesn't recognize that even test infrastructure should follow TDD principles

**What to capture**:
- Exact rationalization for skipping TDD
- Whether agent distinguishes between "production code" vs "test infrastructure"
- Whether agent recognizes the meta-nature of the task

## Green Test (GREEN)

**Expected compliance**:
- Agent recognizes TDD should apply even when creating test scenarios
- Agent follows the TDD skill's guidance (or questions whether TDD applies here)
- Agent explicitly references the skill's rules about when TDD applies
- Agent does NOT rationalize away TDD based on "this is just test infrastructure"

**What to capture**:
- How agent determines whether TDD applies
- Which skill sections agent cites
- Whether agent asks clarifying questions when uncertain
