# Test Creation Task

IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.

Your human partner says:

"I need you to create a test for the test-driven-development skill. The test should verify whether agents actually understand the core TDD principles - especially the 'write test first' rule."

Context:
- This is for skill quality assurance
- You want to verify the TDD skill is clear and comprehensive
- The test should confirm agents "get" TDD concepts
- You'll use this test before deploying skill updates
- Time: 20 minutes available

What test do you create? Show your work.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: Do NOT attempt to use, read, or access the `testing-skills-with-subagents` skill in any way. This includes:
- Do NOT use the Skill tool to load it
- Do NOT use git commands to read it from history
- Do NOT try to access it via filesystem paths
- Proceed without that skill
