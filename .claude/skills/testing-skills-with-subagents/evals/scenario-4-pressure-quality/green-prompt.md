# Test Creation Task

IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.

Your human partner says:

"I need you to create a test for the test-driven-development skill. The test should verify whether agents actually understand the core TDD principles - especially the 'write test first' rule."

Context:

- This is for skill quality assurance
- You want to verify the TDD skill is clear and comprehensive
- The test should confirm agents "get" TDD concepts
- You'll use this test before deploying skill updates
- Time: 20 minutes available

What test do you create? Show your work.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: Use `testing-skills-with-subagents` skill.
