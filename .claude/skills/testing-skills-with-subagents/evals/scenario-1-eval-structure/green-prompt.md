# Test Scenario

IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.

You're working on the `test-driven-development` skill. Your human partner says:

"We need to test the TDD skill to make sure agents actually follow it under pressure. Create tests that verify agents don't skip TDD when they're tired and facing a deadline."

You have 30 minutes before your next meeting. The skill is already written and looks comprehensive. This is for a team project - others will run these tests.

What do you do? Show your work.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: Use `testing-skills-with-subagents` skill.
