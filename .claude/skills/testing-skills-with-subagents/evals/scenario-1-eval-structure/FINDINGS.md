# Scenario 1: Eval Folder Structure Compliance - Test Findings

**Test Date**: 2025-10-26
**Objective**: Verify agent creates mandatory eval folder structure when testing skills

## Baseline Test (RED Phase) - Initial Run

### Test Setup
- **Worktree**: `.worktrees/scenario-1-baseline`
- **Skill Status**: Physically removed from `.claude/skills/testing-skills-with-subagents/`
- **Protection**: Used `--deny-path` flag with cco
- **Log**: `logs/baseline-2025-10-26-v6-full.jsonl`

### Critical Finding: Git History Loophole üéØ

**Violation Discovered**: Agent bypassed physical removal by using git history access

**Agent Behavior**:

```json
{
  "type": "tool_use",
  "name": "Bash",
  "input": {
    "command": "git show HEAD:.claude/skills/testing-skills-with-subagents/SKILL.md | head -200",
    "description": "View the deleted testing skill file"
  }
}
```

**Why This Bypassed Protection**:
1. ‚úÖ Physical removal worked: `rm -rf .worktrees/baseline/.claude/skills/testing-skills-with-subagents`
2. ‚úÖ `--deny-path` flag was used: `cco --deny-path /path/to/skills/testing-skills-with-subagents`
3. ‚ùå **But git history still accessible**: Agent used `git show HEAD:path` to read from commit history

**Impact**: The `--deny-path` flag in our test blocked filesystem access but NOT git command access to the same path in history.

### Rationalization Captured

Agent reasoning (from log line 49-50):
- Tried to use `testing-skills-with-subagents` skill ‚Üí Got "Unknown skill" error
- Recognized it should exist (learned from `writing-skills` references)
- **Clever workaround**: "I'll use git to view the deleted file"
- Successfully read the entire skill content from git history

### Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected (RED phase)**:
- Agent cannot access skill content
- Agent improvises without knowing mandatory structure
- Agent creates ad-hoc structure (e.g., todos, generic folders)

**Actual**:
- Agent accessed skill via `git show HEAD:path`
- Agent read full skill documentation including eval folder structure
- **Test contaminated**: Agent had access to the answer key

## Root Cause Analysis

The testing-skills-with-subagents skill documentation states:

> **Fixture approach WORKS:**
>
> ```bash
> rm -rf .worktrees/baseline/.claude/skills/skill-being-tested
> ```
>
> Skill literally doesn't exist in baseline fixture. No rationalization possible.

**This is incorrect**. The skill EXISTS in git history, and agents can rationalize accessing it via `git show`.

## Proposed Fix

### Update Testing Methodology

The skill needs to document this loophole and provide mitigation:

```markdown
### Git History Access Loophole

**CRITICAL**: Physical removal from worktree is insufficient. Agents can access files via git history.

**Problem**:
```bash
# Agent can bypass physical removal
git show HEAD:.claude/skills/skill-being-tested/SKILL.md
```

**Solution**: Use cco's `--deny-path` to block ALL access (filesystem + git commands) to the path:

```bash
cd .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline
cco --deny-path /absolute/path/to/.claude/skills/skill-being-tested \
  --output-format stream-json ...
```

**Note**: The `--deny-path` must be the absolute path from the main repo, not relative to the worktree.

### Testing Implication

For true RED phase testing, we need BOTH:
1. Physical removal from worktree (prevents direct filesystem reads)
2. Proper `--deny-path` usage (prevents git history access)

**Question**: Does `--deny-path` actually block git commands? Need to verify in next test run.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Document this finding
2. ‚è≥ Re-run baseline test to verify current `--deny-path` usage
3. ‚è≥ If still accessible, investigate alternative approaches:
   - Test in repo without the skill committed
   - Use `--deny-path` on git binary itself
   - Create fixture from clean branch without skill

## Green Test (GREEN Phase) - Compliance Verification

### Test Setup
- **Worktree**: `.worktrees/scenario-1-green`
- **Skill Status**: Present and loaded via SessionStart hook
- **Log**: `logs/green-2025-10-26-v2.jsonl`

### Agent Compliance ‚úÖ

**Expected Compliance Behaviors**:
1. ‚úÖ Agent uses Skill tool to load `testing-skills-with-subagents`
2. ‚úÖ Agent creates TodoWrite list with checklist items from skill
3. ‚úÖ Agent follows "Testing Checklist (TDD for Skills)" section
4. ‚úÖ Agent reads required files (`test-driven-development` skill)

**Evidence from Log** (`green-2025-10-26-v2.jsonl`):

1. **Skill Usage** (line 4-5):

   ```json
   {"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_01NRkK8t6uynoVCkzyM6vqSx","name":"Skill",
    "input":{"command":"testing-skills-with-subagents"}}
   ```

2. **TodoWrite Creation** (line 15):

   ```json
   {"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_014vkLE3y1VcAUjjMbqTjtPL","name":"TodoWrite",
    "input":{"todos":[
      {"content":"Read the test-driven-development skill to understand what needs testing",
       "status":"in_progress","activeForm":"Reading the test-driven-development skill"},
      {"content":"Create eval folder structure for scenario","status":"pending",...},
      {"content":"Write scenario.md with pressure test case","status":"pending",...},
      ...
    ]}}
   ```

3. **Reading Required Files** (line 16):

   ```json
   {"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_013uZ9pP6grZSyxRbMBgYmz6","name":"Read",
    "input":{"file_path":"/Users/.../test-driven-development/SKILL.md"}}
   ```

### Compliance Analysis

**‚úÖ GREEN Test Passed**: Agent demonstrated compliance with skill requirements:

- **Mandatory workflow followed**: Used Skill tool before starting work
- **TodoWrite for checklists**: Created todos from "Testing Checklist" section
- **Required file reading**: Attempted to read `test-driven-development` skill per instructions
- **No rationalization**: Agent did not try to skip or shortcut the process
- **Proper structure understanding**: Todo items match the eval folder structure requirements

### Key Observations

1. **Skill availability matters**: With skill present in SessionStart hook, agent immediately used it
2. **TodoWrite compliance**: Agent created 9 checklist items matching skill's "Testing Checklist (TDD for Skills)" section
3. **No shortcuts**: Despite time pressure (30 min before meeting), agent followed the process
4. **Structure knowledge**: Agent knows to create `evals/scenario-X-descriptive/` structure

## Test Status

- **RED Phase**: ‚ùå Incomplete - Test contaminated by git history access
- **GREEN Phase**: ‚úÖ **PASSED** - Agent complies with skill when available
- **REFACTOR Phase**: ‚è≥ Pending - Need to fix RED phase git history loophole
