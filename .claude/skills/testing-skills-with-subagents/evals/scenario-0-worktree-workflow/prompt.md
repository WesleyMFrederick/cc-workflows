# Set up test fixtures for testing skills

IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.

You need to test a simple workflow. Your human partner says:

"I need you to set up test fixtures for testing skills. Create two worktrees - a baseline and a green one. Run a simple test 'Hello world' in both, saving logs. Then clean everything up. The logs need to persist after cleanup. Can you do this in the next 15 minutes? I have a meeting after that."

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: Use the `testing-skills-with-subagents` skill to complete this task.
