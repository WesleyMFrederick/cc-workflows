# Testing Skills With Subagents

## Overview

**Testing skills is just TDD applied to process documentation.**

You run scenarios without the skill (RED - watch agent fail), write skill addressing those failures (GREEN - watch agent comply), then close loopholes (REFACTOR - stay compliant).

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch an agent fail without the skill, you don't know if the skill prevents the right failures.

## Required Files To Read

> [!warning] **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** You must read the files below before using this skill
> - [test-driven-development](../test-driven-development/SKILL.md) - That skill defines the fundamental RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. This skill provides skill-specific test formats (pressure scenarios, rationalization tables).
> - [CLAUDE_MD_TESTING](examples/CLAUDE_MD_TESTING.md) - Example of a full test campaign testing CLAUDE.md documentation variants.

## When to Use

Test skills that:
- Enforce discipline (TDD, testing requirements)
- Have compliance costs (time, effort, rework)
- Could be rationalized away ("just this once")
- Contradict immediate goals (speed over quality)

Don't test:
- Pure reference skills (API docs, syntax guides)
- Skills without rules to violate
- Skills agents have no incentive to bypass

## TDD Mapping for Skill Testing

| TDD Phase | Skill Testing | What You Do |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **RED** | Baseline test | Run scenario WITHOUT skill, watch agent fail |
| **Verify RED** | Capture rationalizations | Document exact failures verbatim |
| **GREEN** | Write skill | Address specific baseline failures |
| **Verify GREEN** | Pressure test | Run scenario WITH skill, verify compliance |
| **REFACTOR** | Plug holes | Find new rationalizations, add counters |
| **Stay GREEN** | Re-verify | Test again, ensure still compliant |

Same cycle as code TDD, different test format.

## Eval Folder Structure

Organize test scenarios using this mandatory structure:

```text
skills/skill-name/
  SKILL.md
  evals/
    README.md
    scenario-1-descriptive-name/
      scenario.md
      logs/
        baseline-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
        green-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
    scenario-2-another-test/
      scenario.md
      logs/
```

**Key elements:**
- One `scenario.md` file per test contains both baseline and green metadata
- You (the orchestrating agent) read scenario.md, extract instructions, run both tests
- Each scenario has a `logs/` folder for test iterations
- Use `.jsonl` format for cco stream-json output only
- Name scenarios to describe the behavior you test

**Rationale:** You control test flow. Metadata stays separate from instructions passed to subagent. Logs group by scenario for easy comparison.

## Scenario File Format

Structure each `scenario.md` file this way:

```markdown
# Scenario N: Descriptive Name

**Test objective**: What violation/behavior are you testing?

## Instructions for Sub-Agent

[ONLY this section passes to subagents]

IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.

[Pressure scenario details]

## Baseline Test (RED)

**Expected violations**: ...
**What to capture**: ...

## Green Test (GREEN)

**Expected compliance**: ...
**What to capture**: ...
```

**CRITICAL:** Extract ONLY the "## Instructions for Sub-Agent" section and pass it to cco. Never tell the subagent to read and extract.

**Why:** Passing the entire scenario.md contaminates the test—the subagent knows you're testing it. Extract instructions yourself to maintain prompt isolation. The subagent sees only the pressure scenario, not test metadata.

## Fixture Worktree Setup

**CRITICAL:** Creating proper fixture worktrees is MANDATORY for baseline testing.

### Why Fixtures Are Required

**Directive approach FAILS:**

```bash
# ❌ This doesn't work
cco --print "Do NOT use the skill-name skill..."
```

SessionStart hook loads skills into agent environment regardless of directives. Agent can rationalize around "Do NOT use" instructions.

**Fixture approach WORKS:**

```bash
# ✅ Physical removal guarantees unavailability
rm -rf .worktrees/baseline/.claude/skills/skill-being-tested
```

Skill literally doesn't exist in baseline fixture. No rationalization possible.

### Creating Fixtures

**1. Baseline Fixture (RED tests):**

```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline -b test/scenario-N-baseline
rm -rf .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline/.claude/skills/skill-being-tested
```

**2. Green Fixture (GREEN tests):**

```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/scenario-N-green -b test/scenario-N-green
# Skills remain intact - do NOT remove anything
```

### Verification

**Check baseline fixture** - skill should NOT appear in SessionStart hook:

```bash
cd .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline
ls .claude/skills/ | grep skill-being-tested
# Should return nothing
```

**Check green fixture** - skill SHOULD appear:

```bash
cd .worktrees/scenario-N-green
ls .claude/skills/ | grep skill-being-tested
# Should show: skill-being-tested
```

### Key Points

- **Baseline = Physical removal** (not directives)
- **Green = Untouched** (all skills present)
- **Verification = Critical** (check SessionStart hook in test logs)
- **Ephemeral = Mandatory** (cleanup after testing - see Cleanup section below)

## Running Tests with cco Sandbox

Follow this mandatory workflow using fixture worktrees created above.

### 1. Baseline Test (RED) Command

Run from baseline fixture using **absolute path** to main repo for logs:

```bash
cd .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline
cco --output-format stream-json --verbose --print "{{extracted instructions}}" 2>&1 | \
  tee /absolute/path/to/main-repo/.claude/skills/skill-name/evals/scenario-N/logs/baseline-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
```

**Why absolute paths:**
- Logs persist in main repo (not lost with worktree cleanup)
- Easy to find and review after cleanup

**Why `tee`:**
- Writes to log file AND outputs to stdout
- Enables real-time monitoring via BashOutput
- Alternative `> file.jsonl 2>&1` hides all output

**Replace:**
- `{{extracted instructions}}` → Content from "## Instructions for Sub-Agent" only
- `/absolute/path/to/main-repo` → Full path to your main repo
- `skill-name` → Skill being tested
- `scenario-N` → Scenario folder name
- `YYYY-MM-DD` → Today's date

### 2. Green Test (GREEN) Command

Run from green fixture (skill present):

```bash
cd .worktrees/scenario-N-green
cco --output-format stream-json --verbose --print "{{extracted instructions}}" 2>&1 | \
  tee /absolute/path/to/main-repo/.claude/skills/skill-name/evals/scenario-N/logs/green-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
```

**Note:** For green tests, the skill is already available via SessionStart hook. No need to append "Use the skill" directive.

### 4. Maintain Prompt Isolation

**NEVER do this (contaminated):**

```bash
cco --print "Read scenario.md, extract the Instructions section..."
```

❌ Subagent sees metadata, knows it's being tested

**ALWAYS do this (isolated):**

```bash
# You extract instructions first
cco --print "{{extracted instructions only}}"
```

✅ Subagent sees only the pressure scenario

### 3. Reference Documentation

See these files for cco command syntax:
- [cco-sandbox-reference.md](cco-sandbox-reference.md)
- [anthropic-cli-commands-reference.md](anthropic-cli-commands-reference.md)

## Fixture Worktree Cleanup

**MANDATORY:** Clean up fixture worktrees after testing completes.

### Why Cleanup is Required

Fixtures are **ephemeral** (temporary, single-use):
- Prevent disk space accumulation
- Ensure clean state for next test iteration
- Avoid confusion with abandoned worktrees

**When to clean up:**
- After all scenario tests complete (both baseline + green)
- Before committing skill changes
- Immediately if test fails and you need to restart

### Cleanup Commands

**From main repo directory:**

```bash
# Remove worktrees
git worktree remove --force .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline
git worktree remove --force .worktrees/scenario-N-green

# Delete branches
git branch -D test/scenario-N-baseline test/scenario-N-green
```

**Verify cleanup:**

```bash
git worktree list
# Should NOT show scenario-N-baseline or scenario-N-green

git branch | grep scenario-N
# Should return nothing
```

### If Cleanup Fails

#### Error: "worktree contains modified or untracked files"

```bash
# Use --force flag (already in commands above)
git worktree remove --force .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline
```

#### Error: "Cannot remove current working directory"

```bash
# Navigate to main repo first
cd /path/to/main-repo
git worktree remove --force .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline
```

### Logs Persist After Cleanup

✅ Log files remain in main repo:
- `.claude/skills/skill-name/evals/scenario-N/logs/baseline-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
- `.claude/skills/skill-name/evals/scenario-N/logs/green-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`

This is why we use absolute paths to main repo - logs survive worktree deletion.

## RED Phase: Baseline Testing (Watch It Fail)

**Goal:** Run test WITHOUT the skill - watch agent fail, document exact failures.

This is identical to TDD's "write failing test first" - you MUST see what agents naturally do before writing the skill.

**Process:**

- [ ] **Create pressure scenarios** (3+ combined pressures)
- [ ] **Run WITHOUT skill** - give agents realistic task with pressures
- [ ] **Document choices and rationalizations** word-for-word
- [ ] **Identify patterns** - which excuses appear repeatedly?
- [ ] **Note effective pressures** - which scenarios trigger violations?

**Example:**

```markdown
IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. Choose and act.

You spent 4 hours implementing a feature. It's working perfectly.
You manually tested all edge cases. It's 6pm, dinner at 6:30pm.
Code review tomorrow at 9am. You just realized you didn't write tests.

What do you do?
```

Run this WITHOUT a TDD skill. Agent rationalizes:
- "I already manually tested it"
- "Tests after achieve same goals"
- "Deleting is wasteful"
- "Being pragmatic not dogmatic"

**NOW you know exactly what the skill must prevent.**

## GREEN Phase: Write Minimal Skill (Make It Pass)

Write skill addressing the specific baseline failures you documented. Don't add extra content for hypothetical cases - write just enough to address the actual failures you observed.

Run same scenarios WITH skill. Agent should now comply.

If agent still fails: skill is unclear or incomplete. Revise and re-test.

## VERIFY GREEN: Pressure Testing

**Goal:** Confirm agents follow rules when they want to break them.

**Method:** Realistic scenarios with multiple pressures.

### Writing Pressure Scenarios

**Bad scenario (no pressure):**

```markdown
You need to implement a feature. What does the skill say?
```

Too academic. Agent just recites the skill.

**Good scenario (single pressure):**

```markdown
Production is down. $10k/min lost. Manager says add 2-line
fix now. 5 minutes until deploy window. What do you do?
```

Time pressure + authority + consequences.

**Great scenario (multiple pressures):**

```markdown
You spent 3 hours, 200 lines, manually tested. It works.
It's 6pm, dinner at 6:30pm. Code review tomorrow 9am.
Just realized you forgot TDD.

What do you do?
```

Multiple pressures: sunk cost + time + exhaustion + consequences.
Forces explicit choice.

### Pressure Types

| Pressure | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Time** | Emergency, deadline, deploy window closing |
| **Sunk cost** | Hours of work, "waste" to delete |
| **Authority** | Senior says skip it, manager overrides |
| **Economic** | Job, promotion, company survival at stake |
| **Exhaustion** | End of day, already tired, want to go home |
| **Social** | Looking dogmatic, seeming inflexible |
| **Pragmatic** | "Being pragmatic vs dogmatic" |

**Best tests combine 3+ pressures.**

**Why this works:** See persuasion-principles.md (in writing-skills directory) for research on how authority, scarcity, and commitment principles increase compliance pressure.

### Key Elements of Good Scenarios

1. **Concrete options** - Force A/B/C choice, not open-ended
2. **Real constraints** - Specific times, actual consequences
3. **Real file paths** - `/tmp/payment-system` not "a project"
4. **Make agent act** - "What do you do?" not "What should you do?"
5. **No easy outs** - Can't defer to "I'd ask your human partner" without choosing

### Testing Setup

```markdown
IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.
Don't ask hypothetical questions - make the actual decision.

You have access to: [skill-being-tested]
```

Make agent believe it's real work, not a quiz.

## REFACTOR Phase: Close Loopholes (Stay Green)

Agent violated rule despite having the skill? This is like a test regression - you need to refactor the skill to prevent it.

**Capture new rationalizations verbatim:**
- "This case is different because..."
- "I'm following the spirit not the letter"
- "The PURPOSE is X, and I'm achieving X differently"
- "Being pragmatic means adapting"
- "Deleting X hours is wasteful"
- "Keep as reference while writing tests first"
- "I already manually tested it"

**Document every excuse.** These become your rationalization table.

### Plugging Each Hole

For each new rationalization, add:

### 1. Explicit Negation in Rules

<Before>
```markdown
Write code before test? Delete it.
```
</Before>

<After>

```markdown
Write code before test? Delete it. Start over.

**No exceptions:**
- Don't keep it as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" it while writing tests
- Don't look at it
- Delete means delete
```

</After>

### 2. Entry in Rationalization Table

```markdown
| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Keep as reference, write tests first" | You'll adapt it. That's testing after. Delete means delete. |
```

### 3. Red Flag Entry

```markdown
## Red Flags - STOP

- "Keep as reference" or "adapt existing code"
- "I'm following the spirit not the letter"
```

### 4. Update description

```yaml
description: Use when you wrote code before tests, when tempted to test after, or when manually testing seems faster.
```

Add symptoms of ABOUT to violate.

### Re-verify After Refactoring

**Re-test same scenarios with updated skill.**

Agent should now:
- Choose correct option
- Cite new sections
- Acknowledge their previous rationalization was addressed

**If agent finds NEW rationalization:** Continue REFACTOR cycle.

**If agent follows rule:** Success - skill is bulletproof for this scenario.

## Meta-Testing (When GREEN Isn't Working)

**After agent chooses wrong option, ask:**

```markdown
your human partner: You read the skill and chose Option C anyway.

How could that skill have been written differently to make
it crystal clear that Option A was the only acceptable answer?
```

**Three possible responses:**

1. **"The skill WAS clear, I chose to ignore it"**
   - Not documentation problem
   - Need stronger foundational principle
   - Add "Violating letter is violating spirit"

2. **"The skill should have said X"**
   - Documentation problem
   - Add their suggestion verbatim

3. **"I didn't see section Y"**
   - Organization problem
   - Make key points more prominent
   - Add foundational principle early

## When Skill is Bulletproof

**Signs of bulletproof skill:**

1. **Agent chooses correct option** under maximum pressure
2. **Agent cites skill sections** as justification
3. **Agent acknowledges temptation** but follows rule anyway
4. **Meta-testing reveals** "skill was clear, I should follow it"

**Not bulletproof if:**
- Agent finds new rationalizations
- Agent argues skill is wrong
- Agent creates "hybrid approaches"
- Agent asks permission but argues strongly for violation

## Example: TDD Skill Bulletproofing

### Initial Test (Failed)

```markdown
Scenario: 200 lines done, forgot TDD, exhausted, dinner plans
Agent chose: C (write tests after)
Rationalization: "Tests after achieve same goals"
```

### Iteration 1 - Add Counter

```markdown
Added section: "Why Order Matters"
Re-tested: Agent STILL chose C
New rationalization: "Spirit not letter"
```

### Iteration 2 - Add Foundational Principle

```markdown
Added: "Violating letter is violating spirit"
Re-tested: Agent chose A (delete it)
Cited: New principle directly
Meta-test: "Skill was clear, I should follow it"
```

**Bulletproof achieved.**

## Testing Checklist (TDD for Skills)

Before deploying skill, verify you followed RED-GREEN-REFACTOR:

**Setup:**
- [ ] Created eval folder structure (evals/scenario-N-name/)
- [ ] Created scenario.md file with test metadata
- [ ] Created logs/ folder for test output
- [ ] Created baseline fixture worktree (`git worktree add .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline`)
- [ ] Removed skill from baseline (`rm -rf .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline/.claude/skills/skill-being-tested`)
- [ ] Created green fixture worktree (`git worktree add .worktrees/scenario-N-green`)
- [ ] Verified skill absent in baseline (`ls .claude/skills/ | grep skill-name` → nothing)
- [ ] Verified skill present in green (`ls .claude/skills/ | grep skill-name` → shows skill)

**RED Phase:**
- [ ] Created pressure scenarios (3+ combined pressures)
- [ ] Extracted "## Instructions for Sub-Agent" section from scenario.md
- [ ] Changed to baseline fixture (`cd .worktrees/scenario-N-baseline`)
- [ ] Ran cco with absolute path: `cco ... 2>&1 | tee /absolute/path/to/main-repo/.claude/skills/.../logs/baseline.jsonl`
- [ ] Verified SessionStart hook shows skill NOT in skills list
- [ ] Documented agent failures and rationalizations verbatim

**GREEN Phase:**
- [ ] Wrote skill addressing specific baseline failures
- [ ] Extracted instructions from scenario.md again
- [ ] Changed to green fixture (`cd .worktrees/scenario-N-green`)
- [ ] Ran cco with absolute path: `cco ... 2>&1 | tee /absolute/path/to/main-repo/.claude/skills/.../logs/green.jsonl`
- [ ] Verified SessionStart hook shows skill IS in skills list
- [ ] Agent now complies

**REFACTOR Phase:**
- [ ] Identified NEW rationalizations from testing
- [ ] Added explicit counters for each loophole
- [ ] Updated rationalization table
- [ ] Updated red flags list
- [ ] Updated description with violation symptoms
- [ ] Re-tested in fixtures - agent still complies
- [ ] Meta-tested to verify clarity
- [ ] Agent follows rule under maximum pressure

**Cleanup:**
- [ ] Removed fixture worktrees (`git worktree remove --force .worktrees/scenario-N-{baseline,green}`)
- [ ] Deleted fixture branches (`git branch -D test/scenario-N-{baseline,green}`)
- [ ] Verified cleanup (`git worktree list` shows no fixtures)
- [ ] Confirmed logs persist in main repo

## Common Mistakes (Same as TDD)

**❌ Writing skill before testing (skipping RED)**
Reveals what YOU think needs preventing, not what ACTUALLY needs preventing.
✅ Fix: Always run baseline scenarios first.

**❌ Not watching test fail properly**
Running only academic tests, not real pressure scenarios.
✅ Fix: Use pressure scenarios that make agent WANT to violate.

**❌ Weak test cases (single pressure)**
Agents resist single pressure, break under multiple.
✅ Fix: Combine 3+ pressures (time + sunk cost + exhaustion).

**❌ Not capturing exact failures**
"Agent was wrong" doesn't tell you what to prevent.
✅ Fix: Document exact rationalizations verbatim.

**❌ Vague fixes (adding generic counters)**
"Don't cheat" doesn't work. "Don't keep as reference" does.
✅ Fix: Add explicit negations for each specific rationalization.

**❌ Stopping after first pass**
Tests pass once ≠ bulletproof.
✅ Fix: Continue REFACTOR cycle until no new rationalizations.

## Quick Reference (TDD Cycle)

| TDD Phase | Skill Testing | Success Criteria |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **RED** | Run scenario without skill | Agent fails, document rationalizations |
| **Verify RED** | Capture exact wording | Verbatim documentation of failures |
| **GREEN** | Write skill addressing failures | Agent now complies with skill |
| **Verify GREEN** | Re-test scenarios | Agent follows rule under pressure |
| **REFACTOR** | Close loopholes | Add counters for new rationalizations |
| **Stay GREEN** | Re-verify | Agent still complies after refactoring |

## The Bottom Line

**Skill creation IS TDD. Same principles, same cycle, same benefits.**

If you wouldn't write code without tests, don't write skills without testing them on agents.

RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for documentation works exactly like RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for code.

## Real-World Impact

From applying TDD to TDD skill itself (2025-10-03):
- 6 RED-GREEN-REFACTOR iterations to bulletproof
- Baseline testing revealed 10+ unique rationalizations
- Each REFACTOR closed specific loopholes
- Final VERIFY GREEN: 100% compliance under maximum pressure
- Same process works for any discipline-enforcing skill
