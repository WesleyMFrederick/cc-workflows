# Execute Tasks

Execute implementation and validation workflows for task files using dynamic agent orchestration.

## Usage

- `/execute-tasks @tasks/task1.md` - Execute single task file
- `/execute-tasks /full/path/to/task.md` - Execute with full path
- `/execute-tasks @tasks/folder/` - Execute all tasks in folder
- `/execute-tasks @task1.md @task2.md` - Execute multiple tasks
- `/execute-tasks @task1.md /full/path/task2.md` - Mixed path formats

## Input Validation

If no path is provided ($1 is empty), respond with: "Error: Please provide at least one task file or folder path. Usage: /execute-tasks '<path>' '[additional-paths...]'"

<task-paths-input>
Arguments: $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9
</task-paths-input>

<execution-workflow>
## Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Parse Input & Discover Task Files

**For each argument ($1, $2, $3...):**
1. **Resolve Path**: Convert `@file.md` to absolute path, accept full paths as-is
2. **Determine Type**:
   - If path ends with `.md`: Single file
   - If path is directory: Glob for `*.md` files (exclude README.md, index.md)
3. **Collect Task Files**: Build array of absolute paths to process

**Validation**:
- Verify each discovered file exists
- If file not found, report error and continue with remaining files

### Step 2: Read Frontmatter & Build Execution Plan

**For each task file:**

1. **Read Frontmatter** (YAML between `---` markers)

2. **Extract Agent Configuration**:
   - `task-id`: Task identifier for reporting
   - `story`: Story title for branch naming
   - `implementation-agent`: Agent type for implementation (if present)
   - `evaluation-agent`: Agent type for validation (if present)
   - Any other `*-agent` fields for future flexibility

3. **Build Agent Execution List**:
   - If `implementation-agent` present: Add to execution plan
   - If `evaluation-agent` present: Add to execution plan (runs AFTER implementation)
   - If no agents defined: Skip task with warning

4. **Create Todo List with Execution Todos and QA Checkpoints**:
   - Build unified todo list with execution todos (actual work) and QA checkpoints (quality gates) interspersed logically
   - See Todo List Structure section below for detailed specification

### Step 3: Feature Branch Creation (First Task Only)

**Before executing the first task:**

1. **Detect First Task**: Check if this is the first task being executed in the current session
2. **Extract Story Identifier**: Parse frontmatter for `story` field to generate branch name
3. **Create Feature Branch**:
   - Generate `{story-slug}` from story frontmatter (lowercase, hyphens for spaces/special chars)
   - Create branch: `git checkout -b feature/{story-slug}`

4. **Confirm Branch Creation**: Report branch name to user

**If feature branch already exists:**
- Check if already on the feature branch
- If on different branch, ask user whether to:
  - Switch to existing feature branch
  - Create new branch with incremented suffix
  - Continue on current branch

**Skip branch creation if:**
- Already on a feature branch matching the story
- User explicitly disabled branch creation
- Not on main/master branch (assume intentional branch already selected)

### Step 4: Execute Agents Sequentially

**For each task in execution plan:**

#### If `implementation-agent` is defined

Launch the specified agent with this prompt:

```text
Execute [Task ID: {task-id}] from the task document at `{absolute-file-path}`

Read the task document, follow the complete specification under "Objective" and "Required Changes by Component", then populate the "Implementation Agent Notes" section with your completion details.
```

**Mark todo as in_progress before launch, completed after agent returns.**

#### If `evaluation-agent` is defined

Launch the specified agent with this prompt:

```text
Validate [Task ID: {task-id}] from the task document at `{absolute-file-path}`

Review the completed "Implementation Agent Notes" section, execute validation per the "Evaluation Agent Instructions" section, then populate the "Evaluation Agent Notes" section with your findings.
```

**Mark todo as in_progress before launch, completed after agent returns.**

#### Error Handling

- If agent fails, mark as failed in todo list
- Continue with next agent/task (don't halt entire workflow)
- Collect errors for final report

### Step 5: Update Task Status

**After all agents complete for a task:**

1. **Determine Final Status**:
   - If all defined agents succeeded ‚Üí Set `status: "Done"`
   - If any agent failed ‚Üí Set `status: "Failed"`
   - If implementation succeeded but evaluation failed ‚Üí Set `status: "Needs Review"`

2. **Update Frontmatter**:
   - Use Edit tool to modify the `status` field in the task file's YAML frontmatter
   - Locate the line containing `status:` within the frontmatter (between `---` markers)
   - Replace current status value with determined status

   **Step 3 Example: Status Update:**

   ```yaml
   # Before (in task file frontmatter)
   status: "ready"

   # After successful completion
   status: "Done"

   # After failure
   status: "Failed"
   ```

3. **Preserve Other Fields**: Keep all other frontmatter fields unchanged (story, epic, phase, task-id, agents)

4. **Update User Story Task Checkbox** (when status = "Done"):
   - Extract `story` field from task frontmatter to identify parent user story
   - Search for user story document containing matching story title
   - Find task checkbox corresponding to current `task-id`
   - Mark checkbox as complete: `- [ ]` ‚Üí `- [x]`
   - Use Edit tool to update the user story document

   **Step 4 Example: User Story Checkbox Update:**

   ```markdown
   # In user story document

   ## Tasks
   - [x] Task 1.1: Relocate test files (marked when task completes)
   - [ ] Task 1.2: Update parser tests
   - [ ] Task 1.3: Refactor parser
   ```

5. **Update Execution Todo List** (AFTER checkbox update):
   - Mark task execution todo items as `completed` in the execution todo list
   - **Execution Order**: Checkbox updates happen first, then todo list updates
   - This ensures user story reflects completion before execution tracking is marked done
   - Provides proper observability: users see story progress before execution todos complete

### Step 6: Post-Execution Updates & Reporting

**After all tasks complete:**

#### 6.1: Check User Story Completion & Update PRD Status

1. **Extract User Story Reference**:
   - Get `story` field from task frontmatter
   - Locate the user story document containing this story title

2. **Check All Tasks Complete**:
   - Read all task checkboxes in the user story document
   - Count total tasks vs. completed tasks `[x]`
   - If any tasks remain incomplete `[ ]`, skip PRD update

3. **Update PRD Status When Story Complete**:
   - If all task checkboxes are marked complete `[x]`:
     - Search for PRD document that references this user story
     - Locate the status line for this user story in the PRD
     - Update status: `üìã PENDING` ‚Üí `üîç Needs Evaluation`
     - Use Edit tool to update the PRD document

   **Example PRD Status Update:**

   ```markdown
   # Before (in PRD)
   **Status**: üìã PENDING

   # After (when all story tasks complete)
   **Status**: üîç Needs Evaluation
   ```

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If user story document not found: Log warning, continue to reporting
   - If PRD document not found: Log warning, continue to reporting
   - If status line not found in PRD: Log warning, continue to reporting

#### 6.2: Generate Execution Summary Report

```markdown
## Execution Summary

**Feature Branch**: {branch-name}
**Tasks Executed**: {total-count}

### Results by Task

**Task {task-id}** - {file-name}
- Implementation Agent: {agent-type} - {STATUS}
- Evaluation Agent: {agent-type} - {STATUS} (if present)

### Overall Status
- ‚úÖ Passed: {pass-count}
- ‚ùå Failed: {fail-count}
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings: {warning-count}

### Next Steps
[Recommendations based on results]
- Code is on branch: {branch-name}
- Ready to merge if all tests pass
```

</execution-workflow>

<agent-prompt-templates>
## Agent Prompt Templates

### Implementation Agent Prompt

```text
Execute [Task ID: {task-id}] from the task document at `{absolute-file-path}`

Read the task document, follow the complete specification under "Objective" and "Required Changes by Component", then populate the "Implementation Agent Notes" section with your completion details.

**Key Requirements:**
- Read and understand the full task specification
- Execute all changes specified in "Required Changes by Component"
- Run validation commands from "Validation ‚Üí Verify Changes" section
- Populate "Implementation Agent Notes" with:
  - Agent model and version used
  - Files created/modified
  - Implementation challenges encountered
  - Validation command results
```

### Evaluation Agent Prompt

```text
Validate [Task ID: {task-id}] from the task document at `{absolute-file-path}`

Review the completed "Implementation Agent Notes" section, execute validation per the "Evaluation Agent Instructions" section, then populate the "Evaluation Agent Notes" section with your findings.

**Your Validation Tasks:**
1. Verify implementation followed "Required Changes by Component" exactly
2. Check all items in "Success Criteria" section pass
3. Run all validation commands from "Validation ‚Üí Verify Changes" section
4. Confirm "Do NOT Modify" constraints were respected
5. Populate "Evaluation Agent Notes" with validation checklist results, outcome (PASS/FAIL), and any remediation needed
```

<todo-list-instructions>
## Todo List Structure

**Create unified todo list with execution todos and QA checkpoints interspersed:**

### For Single Task Execution

```javascript
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    // Phase 1: Discovery & Planning
    { content: "Discover and validate task files", status: "pending", activeForm: "Discovering task files" },
    { content: "Parse frontmatter configuration", status: "pending", activeForm: "Parsing frontmatter" },

    // Phase 2: Branch Setup (first task only)
    { content: "Create feature branch: feature/{story-slug}", status: "pending", activeForm: "Creating feature branch" },
    { content: "‚úì QA: Branch creation successful", status: "pending", activeForm: "Verifying branch creation" },

    // Phase 3: Implementation
    { content: "Execute Task {task-id} with {implementation-agent}", status: "pending", activeForm: "Executing Task {task-id} with {implementation-agent}" },
    { content: "‚úì QA: Implementation agent completed successfully", status: "pending", activeForm: "Verifying implementation" },

    // Phase 4: Validation (if evaluation-agent defined)
    { content: "Validate Task {task-id} with {evaluation-agent}", status: "pending", activeForm: "Validating Task {task-id} with {evaluation-agent}" },
    { content: "‚úì QA: Evaluation agent completed successfully", status: "pending", activeForm: "Verifying evaluation" },

    // Phase 5: Status Updates
    { content: "Update Task {task-id} status in task file", status: "pending", activeForm: "Updating task status" },
    { content: "Mark Task {task-id} checkbox in user story", status: "pending", activeForm: "Marking checkbox" },
    { content: "‚úì QA: Task status and checkbox updated", status: "pending", activeForm: "Verifying status updates" },

    // Phase 6: Post-Execution & Reporting
    { content: "Check user story completion and update PRD status if complete", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking story completion" },
    { content: "‚úì QA: PRD status updated if applicable", status: "pending", activeForm: "Verifying PRD update" },
    { content: "Generate execution summary report", status: "pending", activeForm: "Generating report" },
    { content: "‚úì QA: All workflow steps completed", status: "pending", activeForm: "Final verification" }
  ]
})
```

### For Multiple Task Execution

For multiple tasks, repeat Phases 3-5 for each task:

```javascript
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    // Phase 1: Discovery & Planning
    { content: "Discover and validate all task files", status: "pending", activeForm: "Discovering task files" },
    { content: "Parse frontmatter for all tasks", status: "pending", activeForm: "Parsing frontmatter" },

    // Phase 2: Branch Setup (if needed)
    { content: "Create/verify feature branch", status: "pending", activeForm: "Setting up branch" },

    // === Task {task-id-1} ===
    { content: "Execute Task {task-id-1} with {implementation-agent-1}", status: "pending", activeForm: "Executing Task {task-id-1}" },
    { content: "Validate Task {task-id-1} with {evaluation-agent-1}", status: "pending", activeForm: "Validating Task {task-id-1}" },
    { content: "Update Task {task-id-1} status and checkbox", status: "pending", activeForm: "Updating Task {task-id-1} status" },
    { content: "‚úì QA: Task {task-id-1} complete", status: "pending", activeForm: "Verifying Task {task-id-1}" },

    // === Task {task-id-2} ===
    { content: "Execute Task {task-id-2} with {implementation-agent-2}", status: "pending", activeForm: "Executing Task {task-id-2}" },
    { content: "Validate Task {task-id-2} with {evaluation-agent-2}", status: "pending", activeForm: "Validating Task {task-id-2}" },
    { content: "Update Task {task-id-2} status and checkbox", status: "pending", activeForm: "Updating Task {task-id-2} status" },
    { content: "‚úì QA: Task {task-id-2} complete", status: "pending", activeForm: "Verifying Task {task-id-2}" },

    // Phase 6: Post-Execution & Reporting
    { content: "Check user story completion and update PRD status if complete", status: "pending", activeForm: "Checking story completion" },
    { content: "‚úì QA: PRD status updated if applicable", status: "pending", activeForm: "Verifying PRD update" },
    { content: "Generate execution summary for all tasks", status: "pending", activeForm: "Generating summary" },
    { content: "‚úì QA: All tasks completed successfully", status: "pending", activeForm: "Final verification" }
  ]
})
```

**Key Principles:**
- **Execution Todos**: Show actual work (agent launches, file updates) with specific task IDs and agent names from frontmatter
- **QA Checkpoints**: Prefixed with "‚úì QA:" to validate preceding work
- **Dynamic Agents**: Use actual agent names from each task's frontmatter (not hardcoded)
- **Skip Missing Agents**: If no evaluation-agent defined, skip validation phase entirely

**Update Rules:**
- Mark `in_progress` immediately before starting each step
- Mark `completed` immediately after each step finishes successfully
- Mark `failed` if any step encounters errors
- QA checkpoints marked `completed` after verifying preceding work

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

**If feature branch creation fails:**

```text
‚ùå Error: Failed to create feature branch {branch-name}. Git error: {error-message}
Options:
1. Fix git issue and retry
2. Continue on current branch (not recommended)
3. Abort execution
```

**If no agents defined in frontmatter:**

```text
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Task {task-id} at {file-path} has no agents defined in frontmatter. Skipping.
```

**If task file missing required frontmatter:**

```text
‚ùå Error: Task file {file-path} missing required frontmatter fields. Skipping.
```

**If agent execution fails:**

```text
‚ùå Failed: {agent-type} for Task {task-id} encountered errors. See agent output for details.
```

**If file not found:**

```text
‚ùå Error: Task file not found at {file-path}. Skipping.
```

**If user story document not found:**

```text
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Could not find user story document for "{story-title}" to update task checkbox. Task status updated in task file only.
```

**If task checkbox not found in user story:**

```text
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Could not find checkbox for Task {task-id} in user story "{story-title}". Task status updated in task file only.
```

**If checkbox update Edit operation fails:**

```text
‚ùå Error: Failed to update checkbox for Task {task-id} in user story "{story-title}". Edit operation error: {error-message}
Task status successfully updated in task file, but user story checkbox update failed.
Options:
1. Manually update the checkbox in the user story document
2. Re-run the execute-tasks command with just this task
3. Continue - task status in task file is accurate
```

<examples>

### Task File Frontmatter Structure

Example frontmatter that the command expects:

```yaml
---
story: "User Story 1.4a: Migrate Test Suite"
epic: "Citation Manager Test Migration & Content Aggregation"
phase: "Phase 1: Test File Relocation and Setup"
task-id: "1.1"
implementation-agent: "code-developer-agent"
evaluation-agent: "application-tech-lead"  # optional
status: "ready"
---
```

### Example 1: Execute Single Task (First Task Creates Branch)

```bash
/execute-tasks @tasks/01-1-1-relocate-test-files-us1.4a.md
```

**Task File Frontmatter:**

```yaml
story: "User Story 1.4a: Migrate Test Suite"
task-id: "1.1"
implementation-agent: "code-developer-agent"
evaluation-agent: "application-tech-lead"
```

**Expected Workflow:**
1. Reads frontmatter ‚Üí extracts story, task-id, and agent types
2. **Creates feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/us1.4a-migrate-test-suite`
3. Creates unified todo list with execution steps and QA checkpoints interspersed
4. Launches code-developer-agent with implementation prompt
5. Launches application-tech-lead with validation prompt
6. Update task status in task file and mark checkbox in user story file
7. Check if all user story tasks complete ‚Üí update PRD status if needed
8. Mark todos as completed throughout execution
9. Reports: "‚úÖ Task 1.1 - 2 agents executed successfully on branch feature/us1.4a-migrate-test-suite"

**Example Todo List During Execution:**
- ‚úÖ Discover and validate task files
- ‚úÖ Parse frontmatter configuration
- ‚úÖ Create feature branch: feature/us1.4a-migrate-test-suite
- ‚úÖ ‚úì QA: Branch creation successful
- ‚úÖ Execute Task 1.1 with code-developer
- ‚úÖ ‚úì QA: Implementation agent completed successfully
- ‚úÖ Validate Task 1.1 with application-tech-lead
- ‚úÖ ‚úì QA: Evaluation agent completed successfully
- ‚úÖ Update Task 1.1 status in task file
- ‚úÖ Mark Task 1.1 checkbox in user story
- ‚úÖ ‚úì QA: Task status and checkbox updated
- ‚úÖ Check user story completion and update PRD status if complete
- ‚úÖ ‚úì QA: PRD status updated if applicable
- ‚è≥ Generate execution summary report
- ‚òê ‚úì QA: All workflow steps completed

### Example 2: Execute Multiple Tasks (Branch Already Exists)

```bash
/execute-tasks @tasks/02-2-1-convert-core-validation-tests-us1.4a.md @tasks/02-2-2-convert-enhanced-citation-tests-us1.4a.md
```

**Expected Workflow:**
1. Checks current branch ‚Üí already on `feature/us1.4a-migrate-test-suite` (created from previous task execution)
2. Skips branch creation (already on correct feature branch)
3. Creates unified todo list for both tasks
4. Processes both files sequentially (implement + validate for each)
5. Updates task status and checkbox after each task completes
6. Checks if all user story tasks complete ‚Üí updates PRD status if needed
7. Reports summary for both tasks

**Example Todo List:**
- ‚úÖ Discover and validate all task files
- ‚úÖ Parse frontmatter for all tasks
- ‚úÖ Create/verify feature branch (skipped - already on correct branch)
- ‚úÖ Execute Task 2.1 with test-writer
- ‚úÖ Validate Task 2.1 with application-tech-lead
- ‚úÖ Update Task 2.1 status and checkbox
- ‚úÖ ‚úì QA: Task 2.1 complete
- ‚è≥ Execute Task 2.2 with test-writer
- ‚òê Validate Task 2.2 with application-tech-lead
- ‚òê Update Task 2.2 status and checkbox
- ‚òê ‚úì QA: Task 2.2 complete
- ‚òê Check user story completion and update PRD status if complete
- ‚òê ‚úì QA: PRD status updated if applicable
- ‚òê Generate execution summary for all tasks
- ‚òê ‚úì QA: All tasks completed successfully

### Example 3: Execute All Tasks in Folder

```bash
/execute-tasks @tasks/
```

**Expected Workflow:**
1. Globs for all .md files in tasks/ folder
2. Filters to only files with agent frontmatter
3. **Before first task**: Creates feature branch from story frontmatter
4. Creates unified todo list with all tasks
5. Executes each task sequentially (implementation + validation for each)
6. Updates task status and checkbox after each task
7. Checks if all user story tasks complete ‚Üí updates PRD status if needed
8. Reports comprehensive summary with branch name

</examples>
