We are working on the calculate risk and critique functionality, making sure that we incorporate the principles. Start off by getting a sense of the project by reading the files, then test the project by running the critique-llm-output prompt for yourself that critiques the implementation. I will then evaluate the output and suggest changes that we incorporate.
