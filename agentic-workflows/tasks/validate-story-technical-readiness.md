# Validate Story Technical Readiness Task

## Purpose

To validate that a story drafted by the Scrum Master is technically feasible, architecturally sound, and contains complete implementation guidance including agent workflow sequencing, task ordering, and all necessary technical context for successful developer handoff.

## Task Execution

**FIRST:** Load `agentic-workflows/config.yaml` and extract configuration values for architecture document paths.

### Phase 1: Load and Assess Technical Feasibility

#### 1.1 Load Story and Configuration Context
- Load and review the draft story document provided as input
- Verify story has passed SM business validation (status should indicate draft completion)
- Load configuration from `agentic-workflows/config.yaml`
- Extract key technical requirements from story acceptance criteria

#### 1.2 Load Relevant Architecture Documentation

**Discovery Strategy:** Use intelligent document discovery to locate architecture documentation relevant to the story scope. Search for architecture directories within project boundaries and load appropriate documents based on story type and component involvement.

**Core Architecture Discovery:**
- Search for `/architecture/` directories within feature or project scope
- Load foundational documents: technology stack, coding standards, testing strategy
- Identify architecture index files (e.g., `index.md`, `architecture.md`) as entry points
- Follow document references and implementation guides as needed

**Story-Type Specific Enhancement:**
- **Backend/API Stories:** Prioritize data models, backend architecture, API specifications
- **Frontend/UI Stories:** Focus on component architecture, frontend patterns, UI conventions
- **Full-Stack Stories:** Load both frontend and backend architectural guidance
- **Infrastructure Stories:** Include deployment, configuration, and operational architecture

**Implementation Guide Discovery:**
- Search for implementation guides related to affected components
- Load component-specific patterns and conventions
- Identify relevant architectural decision records (ADRs)
- Include any config-specified mandatory documents

#### 1.3 Technical Feasibility Assessment
- Validate story requirements align with current architecture decisions
- Assess technical complexity and identify implementation challenges
- Verify integration points are clearly defined and feasible
- Check compatibility with established patterns and conventions
- Document any architectural gaps, conflicts, or technical risks

### Phase 2: Enhance Implementation Guidance and Task Sequencing

#### 2.1 Agent Workflow Sequencing

Define the logical agent workflow based on story requirements and project conventions:

**Standard Implementation Sequence:**
1. **Setup Phase** (if infrastructure needed)
   - Environment setup tasks
   - Testing framework configuration
   - Directory structure creation

2. **Research Phase** (for unknowns)
   - Technology research tasks
   - Pattern investigation
   - Integration approach validation

3. **Test-First Implementation** (TDD/BDD approach when applicable)
   - `test-writer` agent for test implementation
   - Test framework setup if needed
   - Test specification and validation

4. **Core Implementation**
   - `code-developer` agent for feature implementation
   - Following established patterns and standards

5. **Validation & Review**
   - `engineering-mentor-code` agent for implementation validation
   - `qa-validation` agent for final testing and validation

**Agent Selection Criteria:**
- Use `test-writer` first when TDD/BDD is the established pattern
- Use `code-developer` for implementation following test specifications
- Use `engineering-mentor-code` for architectural compliance review
- Use `qa-validation` for final acceptance testing

#### 2.2 Task Sequence Enhancement

Review and enhance the story's task list to ensure:

**Complete Task Coverage:**
- [ ] Setup tasks (if infrastructure changes needed)
- [ ] Research tasks (for unknowns or new patterns)
- [ ] Test implementation tasks (following TDD when applicable)
- [ ] Core implementation tasks (with clear acceptance criteria)
- [ ] Integration tasks (API connections, data flow)
- [ ] Review and validation tasks (mentor review, QA validation)

**Task Sequencing Logic:**
- Infrastructure and setup tasks MUST come first
- Research tasks for unknowns MUST precede implementation
- Test tasks SHOULD precede implementation tasks when TDD is used
- Implementation tasks follow logical dependency order
- Review tasks occur at appropriate checkpoints
- Validation tasks conclude each major phase

#### 2.3 Technical Implementation Guidance Enhancement

Enhance the story's Dev Notes section with:

**Missing Technical Details:**
- Specific file locations and naming conventions
- Code patterns and examples to follow
- Integration patterns and API specifications
- Error handling approaches
- Testing requirements and frameworks
- Security and performance considerations

**Implementation Workflow Planning:**
- Clear implementation milestones
- Agent handoff points and criteria
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Dependencies and blockers identification

### Phase 3: Validate and Report

#### 3.1 Execute Technical Readiness Checklist
- Execute `agentic-workflows/checklists/story-technical-readiness-checklist.md`
- Document technical feasibility assessment results
- Identify any technical blockers or requirements for resolution

#### 3.2 Story Enhancement and Completion
- Update story document with enhanced technical context
- Add complete task list with proper sequencing
- Include agent workflow guidance
- Add architectural decision rationale where needed
- Update story status to reflect technical validation completion

#### 3.3 Create Technical Validation Summary

Document final assessment including:
- **Technical Feasibility**: APPROVED / NEEDS REVISION / BLOCKED
- **Implementation Readiness**: Agent workflow defined, task sequence complete
- **Architecture Alignment**: Score (1-10) with specific findings
- **Task Completeness**: All phases covered (setup, research, test, implement, review)
- **Technical Risks**: Identified risks with mitigation strategies
- **Agent Workflow**: Clear sequencing with handoff criteria
- **Next Steps**: For implementation or further validation needed

## Validation Standards

**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- All technical requirements are architecturally sound and feasible
- Complete task list with logical sequencing and dependencies
- Agent workflow clearly defined with handoff criteria
- Testing approach aligned with project standards (TDD when applicable)
- Setup and infrastructure tasks identified and sequenced first
- Research tasks for unknowns included where needed
- Implementation guidance complete with patterns and examples
- Review and validation checkpoints appropriately placed

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Enhanced story document with complete technical validation
- Technical readiness report with specific findings and recommendations
- Clear APPROVED/NEEDS REVISION/BLOCKED status with detailed rationale
- Complete task list with agent workflow sequencing
- Implementation guidance with architectural compliance assurance

## Agent Workflow Reference

**When to Use Each Agent:**

| Agent | Use When | Prerequisites | Output |
|-------|----------|---------------|---------|
| `test-writer` | TDD/BDD approach, test specifications needed | Test strategy defined | Comprehensive test suite |
| `code-developer` | Feature implementation, code changes | Architecture guidance, test specs (if TDD) | Working implementation |
| `engineering-mentor-code` | Implementation review, architecture compliance | Code implementation complete | Validation report, compliance assessment |
| `qa-validation` | Final testing, acceptance validation | Implementation complete, mentor review passed | Final validation, deployment readiness |

**Sequencing Guidelines:**
- Setup tasks always come first
- Research precedes implementation for unknowns
- Tests precede implementation when TDD is established pattern
- Review occurs at logical checkpoints
- Validation concludes major phases
