# Change Navigation Checklist

**Purpose:** To systematically guide the selected Agent and user through the analysis and planning required when a significant change (pivot, tech issue, missing requirement, failed story) is identified during the BMad workflow.

**Instructions:** Review each item with the user. Mark `[x]` for completed/confirmed, `[N/A]` if not applicable, or add notes for discussion points.

**Change Navigation Context:**

Changes during development are inevitable, but how we handle them determines project success or failure.

Before proceeding, understand:

1. This checklist is for SIGNIFICANT changes that affect the project direction
2. Minor adjustments within a story don't require this process
3. The goal is to minimize wasted work while adapting to new realities
4. User buy-in is critical - they must understand and approve changes

Required context:

- The triggering story or issue
- Current project state (completed stories, current epic)
- Access to PRD, architecture, and other key documents
- Understanding of remaining work planned

**Approach:**
This is an interactive process with the user. Work through each section together, discussing implications and options. The user makes final decisions, but provide expert guidance on technical feasibility and impact.

**Remember:** Changes are opportunities to improve, not failures. Handle them professionally and constructively.

## 1. Understand the Trigger & Context

**Context Analysis Guidelines:**

Start by fully understanding what went wrong and why. Don't jump to solutions yet. Ask probing questions:

- What exactly happened that triggered this review?
- Is this a one-time issue or symptomatic of a larger problem?
- Could this have been anticipated earlier?
- What assumptions were incorrect?

Be specific and factual, not blame-oriented.

- [ ] **Identify Triggering Story:** Clearly identify the story (or stories) that revealed the issue.
- [ ] **Define the Issue:** Articulate the core problem precisely.
  - [ ] Is it a technical limitation/dead-end?
  - [ ] Is it a newly discovered requirement?
  - [ ] Is it a fundamental misunderstanding of existing requirements?
  - [ ] Is it a necessary pivot based on feedback or new information?
  - [ ] Is it a failed/abandoned story needing a new approach?
- [ ] **Assess Initial Impact:** Describe the immediate observed consequences (e.g., blocked progress, incorrect functionality, non-viable tech).
- [ ] **Gather Evidence:** Note any specific logs, error messages, user feedback, or analysis that supports the issue definition.

## 2. Epic Impact Assessment

**Epic Impact Guidelines:**

Changes ripple through the project structure. Systematically evaluate:

1. Can we salvage the current epic with modifications?
2. Do future epics still make sense given this change?
3. Are we creating or eliminating dependencies?
4. Does the epic sequence need reordering?

Think about both immediate and downstream effects.

- [ ] **Analyze Current Epic:**
  - [ ] Can the current epic containing the trigger story still be completed?
  - [ ] Does the current epic need modification (story changes, additions, removals)?
  - [ ] Should the current epic be abandoned or fundamentally redefined?
- [ ] **Analyze Future Epics:**
  - [ ] Review all remaining planned epics.
  - [ ] Does the issue require changes to planned stories in future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue invalidate any future epics?
  - [ ] Does the issue necessitate the creation of entirely new epics?
  - [ ] Should the order/priority of future epics be changed?
- [ ] **Update/Save Epic Impact Summary:** Update/Save brief documentation of the overall effect on the project's epic structure and flow to change analysis file.

## 3. Artifact Conflict & Impact Analysis

**Artifact Analysis Guidelines:**

Documentation drives development in BMad. Check each artifact:

1. Does this change invalidate documented decisions?
2. Are architectural assumptions still valid?
3. Do user flows need rethinking?
4. Are technical constraints different than documented?

Be thorough - missed conflicts cause future problems.

- [ ] **Review PRD:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the core goals or requirements stated in the PRD?
  - [ ] Does the PRD need clarification or updates based on the new understanding?
- [ ] **Review Architecture Document:**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the documented architecture (components, patterns, tech choices)?
  - [ ] Are specific components/diagrams/sections impacted?
  - [ ] Does the technology list need updating?
  - [ ] Do data models or schemas need revision?
  - [ ] Are external API integrations affected?
- [ ] **Review Frontend Spec (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Does the issue conflict with the FE architecture, component library choice, or UI/UX design?
  - [ ] Are specific FE components or user flows impacted?
- [ ] **Review Other Artifacts (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Consider impact on deployment scripts, IaC, monitoring setup, etc.
- [ ] **Update/Save Artifact Impact Summary:** Update/Save list of all artifacts requiring updates and the nature of the changes needed to change analysis file.

## 4. Path Forward Evaluation

**Path Evaluation Guidelines:**

Present options clearly with pros/cons in chat window. For each path:

1. What's the effort required?
2. What work gets thrown away?
3. What risks are we taking?
4. How does this affect timeline?
5. Is this sustainable long-term?

Be honest about trade-offs. There's rarely a perfect solution.

- [ ] **Option 1: Direct Adjustment / Integration:**
  - [ ] Can the issue be addressed by modifying/adding future stories within the existing plan?
  - [ ] Define the scope and nature of these adjustments.
  - [ ] Assess feasibility, effort, and risks of this path.
- [ ] **Option 2: Potential Rollback:**
  - [ ] Would reverting completed stories significantly simplify addressing the issue?
  - [ ] Identify specific stories/commits to consider for rollback.
  - [ ] Assess the effort required for rollback.
  - [ ] Assess the impact of rollback (lost work, data implications).
  - [ ] Compare the net benefit/cost vs. Direct Adjustment.
- [ ] **Option 3: PRD MVP Review & Potential Re-scoping:**
  - [ ] Is the original PRD MVP still achievable given the issue and constraints?
  - [ ] Does the MVP scope need reduction (removing features/epics)?
  - [ ] Do the core MVP goals need modification?
  - [ ] Are alternative approaches needed to meet the original MVP intent?
  - [ ] **Extreme Case:** Does the issue necessitate a fundamental replan or potentially a new PRD V2 (to be handled by PM)?
- [ ] **Select Recommended Path:** Based on the evaluation, agree on the most viable path forward.

## 5. Sprint Change Proposal Components

**Proposal Guidelines:**

The proposal must be actionable and clear. Ensure:

1. The issue is explained in plain language
2. Impacts are quantified where possible
3. The recommended path has clear rationale
4. Next steps are specific and assigned
5. Success criteria for the change are defined

This proposal guides all subsequent work.

(Ensure all agreed-upon points from previous sections are captured in the proposal)

- [ ] **Update/Save Identified Issue Summary:** Update/Save clear, concise problem statement to change proposal file.
- [ ] **Update/Save Epic Impact Summary:** Update/Save how epics are affected to change proposal file.
- [ ] **Update/Save Artifact Adjustment Needs:** Update/Save list of documents to change to change proposal file.
- [ ] **Update/Save Recommended Path Forward:** Update/Save chosen solution with rationale to change proposal file.
- [ ] **Update/Save PRD MVP Impact:** Update/Save changes to scope/goals (if any) to change proposal file.
- [ ] **Update/Save High-Level Action Plan:** Update/Save next steps for stories/updates to change proposal file.
- [ ] **Update/Save Agent Handoff Plan:** Update/Save identified roles needed (PM, Arch, Design Arch, PO) to change proposal file.

## 6. Final Review & Handoff

**Final Review Guidelines:**

Changes require coordination. Before concluding:

1. Is the user fully aligned with the plan?
2. Do all stakeholders understand the impacts?
3. Are handoffs to other agents clear?
4. Is there a rollback plan if the change fails?
5. How will we validate the change worked?

Get explicit approval - implicit agreement causes problems.

**Final Report Instructions:**
After completing the checklist, Update/Save a concise summary to change proposal file with:

- What changed and why
- What we're doing about it
- Who needs to do what
- When we'll know if it worked

Keep it action-oriented and forward-looking.

- [ ] **Review Checklist:** Confirm all relevant items were discussed in chat window.
- [ ] **Review Sprint Change Proposal:** Ensure it accurately reflects the discussion and decisions.
- [ ] **User Approval:** Obtain explicit user approval for the proposal in chat window.
- [ ] **Confirm Next Steps:** Reiterate the handoff plan and the next actions to be taken by specific agents in chat window.
