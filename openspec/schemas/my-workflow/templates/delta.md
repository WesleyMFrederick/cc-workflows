## Same-Units Comparison Table

<!-- One row per attribute from baseline.
  Every baseline attribute must appear.
  "no change" rows validate scope.
  ??? rows are unresolved — block proceeding.
-->

| Attribute | Baseline | Ideal | Delta |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------|
| | | | |

## Unresolved Decisions

<!-- ??? rows from the table above.
  For each: what question, what it depends on, what it cascades to.
  These block the proposal.
-->

---

## Risk Assessment

<!-- Risks visible from the comparison.
  Focus on: schema breaks, consumer compatibility, cascade effects.
  Each risk should cite specific rows in the comparison table.
-->

---

## Scope Boundary

<!-- What is explicitly OUT of scope.
  Derived from "no change" rows and baseline constraints.
