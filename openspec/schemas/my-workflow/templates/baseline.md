## Measurements

<!-- Quantified current state. Include reproduction commands. -->

---

## Inferred Facts [F-INF]

<!-- Conclusions from combining O/M evidence. Cite source steps/measurements. -->

---

## Constraints [C]

<!-- External requirements that cannot change. Hard boundaries on the delta. -->

---

## Assumptions [A]

<!-- Hypotheses not yet tested. These are risks. -->

---

## Open Questions [Q]

<!-- Unknowns surfaced during baseline work. Resolve before ideal if they affect same-units comparison. -->
