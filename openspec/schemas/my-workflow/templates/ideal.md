<!-- Same structure as baseline. Changed values annotated.
  ??? for unresolved values that need decisions.

## Output Mockups

<!-- Concrete examples of target output for every user-facing change.
  One mockup per command/path affected.
-->

---

## Ideal Claims

<!-- What we believe about the target state.
  Tag each: most will be [A] (assumed target) or [D] (decided target).
-->

---

## Same-Units Checklist

<!-- Verify every baseline attribute has a corresponding ideal value.
  List any gaps — these must be resolved before delta.
