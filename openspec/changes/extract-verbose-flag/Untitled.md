Hi Elena,

Our February event is next Wednesday. We will launch the **promo for March 25th (or 26th) @ ProductBoard** next Tuesday or on the day of the event. I will assemble the promo slides and MeetUp page this weekend. 

I **need three things** from you by **Friday, February 20th:**  
1. **Talk title** (e.g., _"From Dabbling to Deploying: What It Takes to Lead AI-Ready Teams"_)
2. **Abstract** (e.g., _"Most product teams assume AI readiness is a tooling problem. In practice, the hardest failures happen earlier, when teams try to move from experimenting with AI to building and shipping non-deterministic systems at scale. This talk draws on original survey data and Elena's work co-teaching the Lead AI-First Teams Workshop to show what actually separates teams that ship from teams that stall."_)  
3. **Key takeaways** (e.g., _"Attendees will learn: how to identify where teams break down when moving from AI dabbling to real deployment; what non-deterministic systems demand that traditional MVP thinking doesn't prepare you for; and repeatable patterns for building AI readiness across resourcing, governance, and change management."_)

**Please also confirm the below is still current:**
