      FIRST: Load `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` and extract `paths.outputBase` and `paths.featurePrefix` values to construct file paths.

      If available, review any provided relevant documents to gather all relevant context before beginning. If at a minimum you cannot locate `${outputBase}/${featurePrefix}/prd.md` ask the user what docs will provide the basis for the architecture.

      - id: intro-content
        content: |
          This document outlines the overall project architecture for {{project_name}}, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

          **Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
          If the project includes a significant user interface, a separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the frontend-specific design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein (see "Tech Stack") are definitive for the entire project, including any frontend components.
      - id: starter-template
        title: Starter Template or Existing Project
        instruction: |
          Before proceeding further with architecture design, check if the project is based on a starter template or existing codebase:

          1. Review the PRD and brainstorming brief for any mentions of:
          - Starter templates (e.g., Create React App, Next.js, Vue CLI, Angular CLI, etc.)
          - Existing projects or codebases being used as a foundation
          - Boilerplate projects or scaffolding tools
          - Previous projects to be cloned or adapted

          2. If a starter template or existing project is mentioned:
          - Ask the user to provide access via one of these methods in chat window:
            - Link to the starter template documentation
            - Upload/attach the project files (for small projects)
            - Share a link to the project repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
          - Analyze the starter/existing project to understand:
            - Pre-configured technology stack and versions
            - Project structure and organization patterns
            - Built-in scripts and tooling
            - Existing architectural patterns and conventions
            - Any limitations or constraints imposed by the starter
          - Update/Save this analysis to the architecture document file

          3. If no starter template is mentioned but this is a greenfield project:
          - Update/Save suggestions for appropriate starter templates based on the tech stack preferences to the architecture document file
          - Update/Save explanation of the benefits (faster setup, best practices, community support) to the architecture document file
          - Ask the user to decide whether to use one in chat window

          4. If the user confirms no starter template will be used:
          - Proceed with architecture design from scratch
          - Note that manual setup will be required for all tooling and configuration

          Update/Save the decision to the architecture document file before proceeding with the architecture design. If none, just say N/A

          1. The main architectural style (e.g., Monolith, Microservices, Serverless, Event-Driven)
          2. Repository structure decision from PRD (Monorepo/Polyrepo)

      - id: architectural-patterns
        title: Architectural and Design Patterns
        instruction: |
          List the key high-level patterns that will guide the architecture. For each pattern:

          1. Present 2-3 viable options in chat window if multiple exist
          2. Update/Save your recommendation with clear rationale to the architecture document file
          3. Get user confirmation in chat window before finalizing
          4. These patterns should align with the PRD's technical assumptions and project goals

          Common patterns to consider:
          - Architectural style patterns (Serverless, Event-Driven, Microservices, CQRS, Hexagonal)
          - Code organization patterns (Dependency Injection, Repository, Module, Factory)
          - Data patterns (Event Sourcing, Saga, Database per Service)
          - Communication patterns (REST, GraphQL, Message Queue, Pub/Sub)
        template: '- **{{pattern_name}}:** {{pattern_description}} - _Rationale:_ {{rationale}}'
        examples:
          - '**Serverless Architecture:** Using AWS Lambda for compute - _Rationale:_ Aligns with PRD requirement for cost optimization and automatic scaling'
          - '**Repository Pattern:** Abstract data access logic - _Rationale:_ Enables testing and future database migration flexibility'
          - '**Event-Driven Communication:** Using SNS/SQS for service decoupling - _Rationale:_ Supports async processing and system resilience'

  - id: tech-stack
    title: Tech Stack

      This is the DEFINITIVE technology selection section. Work with the user to make specific choices:

      1. Review PRD technical assumptions and any preferences from .bmad-core/data/technical-preferences.yaml or an attached technical-preferences
      2. For each category, present 2-3 viable options with pros/cons in chat window
      3. Make a clear recommendation based on project needs
      4. Get explicit user approval for each selection in chat window
      5. Update/Save exact versions (avoid "latest" - pin specific versions) to the architecture document file
      6. This table is the single source of truth - all other docs must reference these choices

      Key decisions to finalize - before displaying the table, ensure you are aware of or ask the user about in chat window - let the user know if they are not sure on any that you can also provide suggestions with rationale:

      - Starter templates (if any)
      - Languages and runtimes with exact versions
      - Frameworks and libraries / packages
      - Cloud provider and key services choices
      - Database and storage solutions - if unclear suggest sql or nosql or other types depending on the project and depending on cloud provider offer a suggestion
      - Development tools

      Upon render of the table, ensure the user is aware of the importance of this sections choices, should also look for gaps or disagreements with anything, ask for any clarifications in chat window if something is unclear why its in the list, and also right away elicit feedback - this statement and the options should be rendered and then prompt right all before allowing user input.

    title: Security
    instruction: |
      Define MANDATORY security requirements for AI and human developers:

      1. Focus on implementation-specific rules
      2. Reference security tools from Tech Stack
      3. Update/Save clear patterns for common scenarios to the architecture document file
      4. These rules directly impact code generation
      5. Work with user in chat window to ensure completeness without redundancy

    title: Next Steps
    instruction: |
      After completing the architecture:

      1. If project has UI components:
      - Use "Frontend Architecture Mode"
      - Provide this document as input

      2. For all projects:
      - Review with Product Owner
      - Begin story implementation with Dev agent
      - Set up infrastructure with DevOps agent

      3. Include specific prompts for next agents if needed
    sections:
      - id: architect-prompt
        title: Architect Prompt
        condition: Project has UI components
        instruction: |
          Create a brief prompt to hand off to Architect for Frontend Architecture creation. Update/Save to the architecture document file:
          - Reference to this architecture document
          - Key UI requirements from PRD
          - Any frontend-specific decisions made here
          - Request for detailed frontend architecture
