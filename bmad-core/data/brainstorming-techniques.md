# Brainstorming Techniques Data

## Creative Expansion

1. **What If Scenarios**: Explore possibilities through hypothetical scenarios. Ask one provocative question, get their response, then ask another
2. **Analogical Thinking**: Draw insights from similar situations in different domains. Give one example analogy, ask them to find 2-3 more
3. **Reversal/Inversion**: Flip problems upside down to reveal new perspectives. Pose the reverse question, let them work through it
4. **First Principles Thinking**: Strip away assumptions to reach fundamental truths. Ask "What are the fundamentals?" and guide them to break it down

## Structured Frameworks

1. **SCAMPER Method**: Systematic creativity using substitute, combine, adapt, modify, put to other uses, eliminate, reverse. Go through one letter at a time, wait for their ideas before moving to next
2. **Six Thinking Hats**: Examine problems from six distinct thinking perspectives. Present one hat, ask for their thoughts, then move to next hat
3. **Mind Mapping**: Visualize ideas as interconnected branches from a central theme. Start with central concept, ask them to suggest branches

## Collaborative Techniques

1. **"Yes, And..." Building**: Build on ideas without rejection to maintain creative flow. They give idea, you "yes and" it, they "yes and" back - alternate
2. **Brainwriting/Round Robin**: Iterate and expand ideas through collaborative building. They suggest idea, you build on it, ask them to build on yours
3. **Random Stimulation**: Spark creativity through unexpected triggers and associations. Give one random prompt/word, ask them to make connections

## Deep Exploration

1. **Five Whats**: Dig deeper into root causes through iterative questioning. Ask "what" and wait for their answer before asking next "what". Example, "What led you to this idea?"
2. **Morphological Analysis**: Systematically explore all possible parameter combinations. Ask them to list parameters first, then explore combinations together
3. **Provocation Technique (PO)**: Use deliberate provocations to break thinking patterns. Give one provocative statement, ask them to extract useful ideas

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Forced Relationships**: Generate insights by linking seemingly unconnected elements. Connect two unrelated concepts and ask them to find the bridge
2. **Assumption Reversal**: Question fundamental beliefs to unlock new possibilities. Challenge their core assumptions and ask them to build from there
3. **Role Playing**: Explore solutions through various stakeholder viewpoints. Ask them to brainstorm from different stakeholder perspectives
4. **Time Shifting**: Examine problems through different temporal contexts. "How would you solve this in 1995? 2030?"
5. **Resource Constraints**: Force creative solutions through artificial limitations. "What if you had only $10 and 1 hour?"
6. **Metaphor Mapping**: Understand complex problems through symbolic representations. Use extended metaphors to explore solutions
7. **Question Storming**: Focus on problem framing before solution generation. Generate questions instead of answers first
