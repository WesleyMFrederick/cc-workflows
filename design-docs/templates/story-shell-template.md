# Story [Story Number]: [Story Title]

> [!attention] **AI Story Shell Template Instructions**
> **CRITICAL**: This template is for Phase 1 - Story creation without task information
> **CRITICAL**: Instructions for the AI are in callouts using this format: > [!attention] **AI {{task instruction title}}**
> **CRITICAL**: Goals for a document section are in callouts using this format: > [!done] **AI {{section}} Goal**

> **Prime Directive #1: Architectural Context First.** Gather complete C4 architectural context before creating story content. Every technical detail must be supported by citations to architecture documents.
>
> **Prime Directive #2: Citation Integrity.** All architectural references must be validated using citation manager before story completion. Use natural language integration for citations wherever possible.
>

**Critical LLM Initialization Instructions**: When first reading this file, you MUST IMMEDIATELY run citation manager to extract base paths: `npm run citation:base-paths <this-file-path> -- --format json`. Read ALL discovered base path files to gather complete architectural context before proceeding.

## Status
[Current status: Draft | In Progress | Ready for Review | Complete]

> [!done] **AI Story Definition Goal**
> **Extract Story from Epic Requirements**
> Copy the story definition and acceptance criteria EXACTLY from the epic source document. Focus on user value and business outcomes.
> > [!attention] **AI Story Definition Instructions:**
> > - GIVEN a story from an epic/PRD, WHEN creating the story THEN copy the epic's story statement and acceptance criteria EXACTLY
> > - Use the standard "As a... I want... so that..." format
> > - Preserve original acceptance criteria with anchor references
> > - Include epic source citation for traceability

## Story

**As a** [user role],
**I want** [capability or feature],
**so that** [business value or benefit].

_Source: [Epic Name]([link to epic file]#[story section])_

> [!example] **AI Story Definition Example**
> **As a** Technical PM,
> **I want** the system to automatically detect the binary's version and create a corresponding versioned directory,
> **so that** analysis artifacts are organized systematically without manual intervention.
>
> _Source: [Epic 1 Stories](../epics/epic-1-workspace-scaffolding.md#Story%201-1)_

## Acceptance Criteria

> [!attention] **AI Acceptance Criteria Instructions:**
> - Copy the epic's acceptance criteria EXACTLY with original anchor references
> - Each criterion should be independently verifiable
> - Use EARS based language (WHEN..., THEN ... SHALL; IF ..., THEN ..., SHALL; etc.)
> - Maintain original numbering from epic source

1. [Acceptance criterion from epic with original anchor] ^US[story-number]AC1
2. [Second criterion from epic with original anchor] ^US[story-number]AC2
3. [Additional criteria following same pattern...] ^US[story-number]AC[number]

_Source: [Epic Name]([link to epic file]#[acceptance criteria section])_

> [!example] **AI Acceptance Criteria Example**
> 1. WHEN the `Code Processing Application` starts, THEN the system SHALL extract the version number from the source binary. ^US1-1AC1
> 2. IF a directory for the extracted version does not exist, THEN the system SHALL create it. ^US1-1AC2
> 3. IF version detection fails, THEN the system SHALL log the failure AND create a new directory using a unique identifier. ^US1-1AC3

## Dev Notes

> [!done] **AI Dev Notes Goal**
> **Package Complete Architectural Context**
> Gather and organize all architectural information needed for task generation in subsequent phases. Every technical detail must include proper citations.

### Design Principles Adherence

> [!attention] **AI Design Principles Instructions:**
> - Reference specific design principles from the project's Design Principles document
> - Organize into Critical Principles and Anti-Patterns to Avoid
> - Include implementation guidance for each principle
> - Focus on principles most relevant to this story's implementation

This story must adhere to the following [Design Principles]([link to design principles doc]):

**Critical Principles:**
- [**[Principle Name]**]([link to principle definition]) ([Category]): [How this principle applies to the story implementation]
- [**[Another Principle]**]([link to principle definition]) ([Category]): [Application guidance for this story]

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- [**[Anti-Pattern Name]**]([link to anti-pattern definition]): [Specific guidance for avoiding this anti-pattern in this story]

**Implementation Guidance:**
- [Specific implementation guidance item 1]
- [Specific implementation guidance item 2]

> [!example] **AI Design Principles Example**
> **Critical Principles:**
> - [**Atomic Operations**](../design-principles.md#Atomic%20Operations) (Safety-First): Directory creation process must be atomic with complete rollback on failure
> - [**Dependency Abstraction**](../design-principles.md#Dependency%20Abstraction) (Modular): Components depend on abstractions (interfaces) not concrete implementations
>
> **Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
> - [**Hidden Global State**](../design-principles.md#Hidden%20Global%20State): Keep all state explicit in component constructors and method parameters
>
> **Implementation Guidance:**
> - Version parsing logic must be deterministic and predictable
> - Error recovery must be graceful with meaningful context

### Previous Story Insights

> [!attention] **AI Previous Story Insights Instructions:**
> - Reference learnings from previous stories in the same epic
> - Note any dependencies or prerequisites from earlier stories
> - Include any course corrections or lessons learned
> - If no previous stories exist, state clearly

[Summary of insights from previous stories, dependencies, and lessons learned. If no previous stories: "No previous stories - this is the first story in Epic [number]"]

> [!example] **AI Previous Story Insights Example**
> **Dependencies from Story 1.0:** Workspace scaffolding must be complete before version detection can be implemented.
> **Lesson Learned:** Mock binary approach from Story 1.0 testing strategy should be reused for version detection testing.
