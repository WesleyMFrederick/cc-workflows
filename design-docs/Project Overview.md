# CC Workflows Project Overview

## Project Basics
- **Project Name**: CC Workflows
- **Tagline**: A refined, repeatable, and robust framework for the improvement development lifecycle.

## Vision Statement
To create a welcoming and approachable toolkit that empowers you to build better, faster. This framework is designed to make the development lifecycle—whether for products, processes, or personal projects—more refined, repeatable, and ultimately, more impactful.

## Problem Statement
Great ideas for improving workflows often get scattered across different projects, leading to duplicated effort and inconsistent quality. Without a central hub, valuable tools and processes are built in isolation, unable to benefit from a shared, robust infrastructure for things like testing and builds. This fragmentation makes it frustrating and time-consuming to refine, share, and scale best practices.

## Solution
CC Workflows provides a centralized, organized repository that acts as a single source of truth for your development practices. It's a foundational toolkit that allows you to refine and scale your best ideas in one place. By establishing a consistent, shared infrastructure for testing and builds, it ensures that every new tool, agent, or process you create is robust and reliable from the start. This framework allows you to easily scaffold new projects with proven patterns and provides a dedicated space to enhance and evolve your tools, like the citation manager, with new capabilities.

## Target Audience
The primary audience is myself, for personal and professional development projects.

## Success Metrics
Success is measured by a significant reduction in the time spent on repetitive tasks like edits and context shaping. The project will be successful when its tools measurably improve an LLM's ability to focus on the correct context, thereby reducing the manual effort of copying and pasting information.

## Project Scope
- **Initial Version (MVP):** The foundational goal is to establish a well-organized workspace. This includes creating a centralized infrastructure for testing and builds, and defining a consistent set of coding conventions and processes. This core setup will support all future development. ^project-scope-future-updates-workspace
- **Citation Manager 2.0:** Enhance the citation manager to not only link to documents but also extract and include specific content from cited sections. ^project-scope-future-updates-citation-manager
- **Future Updates:**
    - **Context Engineering:** Develop a deterministic context package manager, potentially paired with a specialized "Context Engineer" agent, to automate the creation of highly-relevant prompts.
    - **System Refinement:** Continuously improve the entire framework by refining agents, workflows, and templates, and expanding the evaluation (`Evals`) system to ensure quality and impact.

## Risk Assessment
The primary risk is over-engineering and scope creep. The desire to make the framework perfect can lead to delays and building more than what's needed for the MVP. The main challenge will be maintaining a strict focus on "just enough" functionality to get the system up and running quickly, with the discipline to refine it over time rather than perfecting it upfront.

## Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful when a clear, centralized workspace organization is established, complete with a shared testing and build infrastructure. Success also requires defined coding conventions and a repeatable process for developing, testing, and refining sub-features within this new structure.
