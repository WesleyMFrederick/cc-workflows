# Task 1.0: Create Workspace Directory Structure - Implementation Details

## Implementation Gap

- **Objective**: Create foundational workspace directories required for NPM Workspaces configuration
- **Current State**: Repository root contains only existing citation-manager infrastructure (`package.json`, `vitest.config.js`, `biome.json`) and legacy `src/` structure. No `tools/` or `packages/` directories exist.
- **Required State**: Empty `tools/` and `packages/` directories exist at repository root, ready to be referenced by NPM Workspaces configuration in Task 1.1
- **Integration Requirement**: These directories establish the physical foundation for NPM Workspaces monorepo structure and must exist before workspace configuration can reference them

## Background Context

### Architectural Context

This task establishes the foundational Level 2 Container directory structure for the CC Workflows Workspace. The `tools/` directory will house CLI tools and utilities (starting with mock-tool for pattern validation), while `packages/` is reserved for future shared library packages. This structure enables NPM Workspaces to discover and manage multiple packages within a single repository.

### Previous Subtask Dependencies

**Dependencies**: None (first task in Story 1.1)
**Available Assets**: Existing root `package.json`, `vitest.config.js`, `biome.json`
**Integration Points**: Directories will be referenced by Task 1.1's workspace configuration

### Context Gathering Steps

1. **Verify repository root location**: Confirm current directory contains `package.json` at root level
2. **Check for existing directories**: Verify `tools/` and `packages/` do not already exist
3. **Validate workspace readiness**: Ensure no conflicting directory structures exist

## Implementation Requirements

### Files

- `tools/` (create) - Directory for workspace CLI tool packages
- `packages/` (create) - Directory for workspace library packages

### Change Patterns

**Directory creation scenario**:

1. Navigate to repository root (where package.json exists)
2. Create `tools/` directory using standard mkdir command
3. Create `packages/` directory using standard mkdir command
4. Verify both directories exist and are empty

```bash
# Target Pattern: Create empty directories at repository root
mkdir tools
mkdir packages
```

### Critical Rules

- Directories must be created at repository root (same level as package.json)
- Directories must be empty (no placeholder files like .gitkeep needed)
- Directory names must exactly match workspace configuration patterns: `tools` and `packages`

## Key Implementation Elements

### Primary Changes

1. **Directory Creation**: Create two empty directories at repository root using mkdir command
2. **Integration Points**: Directories establish the foundation for NPM Workspaces package discovery pattern `["tools/*", "packages/*"]`
3. **Validation Strategy**: Verify directories exist using ls command and confirm they are empty

### Technical Specifications

**Directory Location**: Must be at repository root (same directory level as `package.json`)
**Directory Names**: Exactly `tools` and `packages` (lowercase, no special characters)
**Directory State**: Empty (will be populated by subsequent tasks starting with Task 2.1)

### Expected Outcome

**Output**: Two empty directories (`tools/` and `packages/`) at repository root
**Scope**:
- `tools/` directory created
- `packages/` directory created
- Both directories confirmed empty
**Success Criteria**: ls command shows both directories exist, ls -A shows they are empty

## Immediate Validation

### Validation Commands

```bash
ls -ld tools/ packages/
# Expected result: Both directories listed with correct permissions

ls -A tools/
# Expected result: No output (empty directory)

ls -A packages/
# Expected result: No output (empty directory)

ls -1 | grep -E '(tools|packages|package.json)'
# Expected result: All three items present, confirming correct location
```

### Success Indicators

- [ ] **Directories Exist**: `ls -ld tools/ packages/` shows both directories
- [ ] **Directories Empty**: `ls -A tools/` and `ls -A packages/` return no output
- [ ] **Correct Location**: Directories are at same level as `package.json`

## Integration Notes

### Component Integration

**NPM Workspaces Foundation**: These directories are referenced by the workspace configuration pattern `["tools/*", "packages/*"]` that Task 1.1 will add to package.json
**Task 2.1 Preparation**: `tools/` directory will receive the first workspace package (`mock-tool/`) in Task 2.1
**Git Integration**: Empty directories will not be committed until Task 2.1 adds content (Git does not track empty directories)

### Follow-Up Considerations

Task 1.1 will immediately add workspace configuration referencing these directories. Task 2.1 will populate `tools/` with the first workspace package. The `packages/` directory remains reserved for future library packages beyond Story 1.1 scope.
