## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to move the `citation-manager` source code and its related assets into the new workspace package structure,
**so that** the tool is properly located within the centralized framework.

_Source: [Story 1.2: Migrate `citation-manager` Source Code](../../cc-workflows-workspace-prd.md#Story%201.2%20Migrate%20`citation-manager`%20Source%20Code)_

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GIVEN the new workspace structure, WHEN the `citation-manager`'s source files are moved, THEN they SHALL reside in `tools/citation-manager/src/` directory. ^US1-2AC1

2. GIVEN the `citation-manager`'s supporting documents, WHEN they are moved, THEN:
   - Tool overview (`README.md`) SHALL be co-located in `tools/citation-manager/`
   - Tool architecture baseline (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) SHALL be migrated to `tools/citation-manager/design-docs/Architecture.md`
   - Historical feature documentation (`tasks/250919-auto-fix-short-file-names/`) SHALL be migrated to `tools/citation-manager/design-docs/features/250919-auto-fix-short-file-names/` ^US1-2AC2

> **Safety Decision**: Original AC3 (legacy location cleanup) has been **deferred to Story 1.4** to preserve source files until test migration completes. This follows the **Safety-First Design** principle - we don't delete anything until all validation (US1.3 executability, US1.4 test migration) confirms success.

## Dev Notes

### Architectural Context (C4)

This story performs file relocation to establish the citation-manager as a proper workspace package following patterns validated in Story 1.1.

- **Components Affected**:
  - [CC Workflows Workspace](../../cc-workflows-workspace-architecture.md#CC%20Workflows%20Workspace) - Adding citation-manager as first production tool package following workspace infrastructure established in Story 1.1
  - [Tool Packages](../../cc-workflows-workspace-architecture.md#Tool%20Packages) - Citation-manager becomes first production tool in workspace, validating workspace pattern for complex, real-world tools
- **Implementation Guides**:
  - [Directory Organization](../../cc-workflows-workspace-architecture.md#Directory%20Organization) - Workspace package structure standards defining `tools/` hierarchy
  - [Tool/Package Documentation Organization](../../cc-workflows-workspace-architecture.md#Tool/Package%20Documentation%20Organization) - Documentation hierarchy pattern for self-contained tool packages
  - [File Naming Patterns](../../cc-workflows-workspace-architecture.md#File%20Naming%20Patterns) - Naming conventions for tool scripts, source modules, and configuration files

### Technical Details

- **File Locations** (Migration Map):

  **Source Files:**
  - `src/tools/utility-scripts/citation-links/citation-manager.js` (527 lines) â†’ `tools/citation-manager/src/citation-manager.js` (RELOCATED)
  - `src/tools/utility-scripts/citation-links/src/CitationValidator.js` â†’ `tools/citation-manager/src/CitationValidator.js` (RELOCATED)
  - `src/tools/utility-scripts/citation-links/src/MarkdownParser.js` â†’ `tools/citation-manager/src/MarkdownParser.js` (RELOCATED)
  - `src/tools/utility-scripts/citation-links/src/FileCache.js` â†’ `tools/citation-manager/src/FileCache.js` (RELOCATED)

  **Documentation:**
  - `src/tools/utility-scripts/citation-links/README.md` (736 lines) â†’ `tools/citation-manager/README.md` (RELOCATED)
  - `src/tools/utility-scripts/citation-links/ARCHITECTURE.md` (644 lines) â†’ `tools/citation-manager/design-docs/Architecture.md` (RELOCATED)
  - `src/tools/utility-scripts/citation-links/tasks/250919-auto-fix-short-file-names/` â†’ `tools/citation-manager/design-docs/features/250919-auto-fix-short-file-names/` (RELOCATED - entire directory with historical feature documentation)

  **Tests:** (Story 1.4 scope - NOT migrated in this story)
  - `src/tools/utility-scripts/citation-links/test/` â†’ (deferred to Story 1.4)
  - `src/tools/utility-scripts/citation-links/test/fixtures/` â†’ (deferred to Story 1.4)

- **Technology Stack**: [Node.js](../../cc-workflows-workspace-architecture.md#Technology%20Stack), ESM modules (no changes - pure file relocation)

- **Dependencies**:
  - **Prerequisite**: [Story 1.1](../us1.1-establish-workspace-directory-structure-and-basic-config/us1.1-establish-workspace-directory-structure-and-basic-config.md) (workspace structure `tools/` and `packages/` directories must exist)
  - **Enables**: Story 1.3 (executable configuration requires relocated files at correct paths)
  - **Enables**: Story 1.4 (test migration requires relocated source to establish proper test paths)

- **Technical Constraints**:
  - [Preserve git history](../../../../Architecture%20Principles.md#^foundation-reuse) via `git mv` operations exclusively
  - No code modifications allowed - maintain exact file contents (zero diffs except path)
  - Module import path updates explicitly deferred to Story 1.3 (executable configuration)
  - Test migration explicitly out of scope - deferred to Story 1.4
  - **Legacy location cleanup deferred to Story 1.4** (Safety-First: preserve source files until test migration and executability validation complete in US1.3 and US1.4)
  - [Follow workspace directory conventions](../../cc-workflows-workspace-architecture.md#Directory%20Organization) from Story 1.1 validation
  - Historical feature documentation must preserve complete directory structure and file organization

### Design Principles Adherence

This story must adhere to the following [Design Principles](../../../../Architecture%20Principles.md):

**Critical Principles:**
- [**Foundation Reuse**](../../../../Architecture%20Principles.md#^foundation-reuse) (MVP): Migrating citation-manager into centralized workspace establishes single source of truth for tool development, eliminating duplicated effort across projects
- [**Replaceable Parts**](../../../../Architecture%20Principles.md#^replaceable-parts) (Modular Design): Each tool maintains self-contained documentation hierarchy within workspace package structure, enabling independent evolution and replacement
- [**Simplicity First**](../../../../Architecture%20Principles.md#^simplicity-first) (MVP): Pure file relocation without premature refactoring - defer code changes to subsequent stories to minimize risk
- [**Tool-First Design**](../../../../Architecture%20Principles.md#^tool-first-design) (Deterministic Offloading): Use `git mv` to preserve file history rather than manual copy operations, leveraging deterministic tools for mechanical tasks

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- [**Scattered Checks**](../../../../Architecture%20Principles.md#^scattered-checks): Avoid validating migration success through multiple manual checks - create single validation script that verifies all acceptance criteria
- [**Over-Engineered Structures**](../../../../Architecture%20Principles.md#^over-engineered-structures): Follow established workspace patterns from Story 1.1, don't introduce custom documentation structures or premature organizational complexity

**Implementation Guidance:**
- Use `git mv` exclusively for file relocation to preserve complete commit history and attribution
- Maintain exact file contents - zero code modifications in this story (import path updates deferred to Story 1.3)
- Follow [Tool/Package Documentation Organization](../../cc-workflows-workspace-architecture.md#Tool/Package%20Documentation%20Organization) pattern validated in Story 1.1 mock-tool proof-of-concept
- Verify migration using file existence checks at new locations, not content validation (no code changes means content unchanged)
- Preserve directory structure for historical feature documentation (250919-auto-fix-short-file-names/) to maintain implementation history integrity

### Previous Story Insights

**Dependencies from Story 1.1:**
- Workspace directory structure (`tools/`, `packages/`) must exist before citation-manager can be migrated
- Workspace patterns validated through mock-tool proof-of-concept provide implementation roadmap
- Story 1.1 established that ESM module system is workspace standard (root package.json `"type": "module"`)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Mock-tool approach in Story 1.1 successfully validated workspace integration patterns without risk to production code
- NPM Workspaces configuration, Vitest test discovery, and Biome linting all function correctly with `tools/` package structure
- Directory organization pattern (src/, test/, design-docs/) proven effective for self-contained tool packages

**Architectural Validation:**
- Story 1.1 confirmed workspace can support multiple packages with proper isolation
- Test discovery pattern `tools/**/test/**/*.test.js` works alongside legacy patterns
- Documentation organization using `design-docs/` subdirectory maintains clean separation

**Course Correction:**
- Story 1.1 revealed Biome schema issues (deprecated `includes` key) - ensure architectural documentation reflects current schema
- Module system decision (ESM vs CommonJS) already established at root level - citation-manager already uses ESM, so no conversion needed

### Testing

- **Test Framework**: N/A - No test code created for this story
- **Test Strategy**: [Story Testing (Lean Outcome Validation)](../../cc-workflows-workspace-architecture.md#Story%20Testing%20Lean%20Outcome%20Validation) via `qa-validation` agent - Verify migration outcome through direct file and git checks, not automated test scripts
- **Validation Approach**: Manual verification by qa-validation agent (simpler than creating one-time test scripts for file migration)

#### QA Validation Requirements

##### 1. Source File Migration Validation (Outcome Validation)
- **Purpose**: Verify all source files relocated to correct workspace locations with exact file counts
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Validates [[#^US1-2AC1|AC1]]
- **Implementation Guidance**:
  - Check file existence at new paths: `tools/citation-manager/src/*.js` (4 files expected: citation-manager.js, CitationValidator.js, MarkdownParser.js, FileCache.js)
  - Verify file count matches original (4 source files)
  - Confirm all files use PascalCase naming for classes, kebab-case for CLI entry point

##### 2. Documentation Migration Validation (Outcome Validation)
- **Purpose**: Verify documentation follows workspace organization pattern with proper hierarchy
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Validates [[#^US1-2AC2|AC2]]
- **Implementation Guidance**:
  - Verify `tools/citation-manager/README.md` exists (736 lines - tool overview)
  - Verify `tools/citation-manager/design-docs/Architecture.md` exists (644 lines - architecture baseline)
  - Verify `tools/citation-manager/design-docs/features/250919-auto-fix-short-file-names/` directory exists
  - Check feature directory contains all original task files (9 markdown files expected)
  - Confirm documentation hierarchy matches [Tool/Package Documentation Organization](../../cc-workflows-workspace-architecture.md#Tool/Package%20Documentation%20Organization) pattern

##### 3. Git History Preservation Validation (Outcome Validation)
- **Purpose**: Verify git history preserved through git mv operations
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Validates [[#^US1-2AC1|AC1]], [[#^US1-2AC2|AC2]]
- **Implementation Guidance**:
  - Run `git log --follow` on migrated files to confirm file tracking works
  - Verify git status shows "renamed" operations, not "added/deleted"
  - Confirm file contents unchanged (line counts match original)

> **Note**: Legacy location cleanup (original AC3) deferred to Story 1.4 for safety - source files remain at original location until test migration validates success.

### Agent Workflow Sequence

**Implementation should follow this agent workflow:**

1. **Directory Setup Phase** (`code-developer-agent`):
   - Create `tools/citation-manager/` directory structure (src/, design-docs/, design-docs/features/)
   - Verify directories created at correct workspace locations

2. **Migration Phase** (`code-developer-agent`):
   - Execute `git mv` operations for 4 source files to `tools/citation-manager/src/`
   - Execute `git mv` for README.md to `tools/citation-manager/`
   - Execute `git mv` for ARCHITECTURE.md to `tools/citation-manager/design-docs/Architecture.md`
   - Execute `git mv` for historical feature directory to `tools/citation-manager/design-docs/features/250919-auto-fix-short-file-names/`
   - Confirm git status shows only renames (mv operations), no file modifications

3. **QA Validation Phase** (`qa-validation`):
   - Verify all 4 source files exist at new locations (citation-manager.js, CitationValidator.js, MarkdownParser.js, FileCache.js)
   - Verify README.md exists at tool root
   - Verify Architecture.md exists in design-docs/
   - Verify historical feature documentation preserved in design-docs/features/
   - Run file count validation (4 source + 1 README + 1 ARCHITECTURE + feature docs)
   - Confirm git log shows preserved history via `git log --follow` on migrated files
   - Verify file contents unchanged (line counts match original)

> **Note**: Legacy location cleanup deferred to Story 1.4 - source files intentionally remain at original location until test migration (US1.4) validates success.

wc -l tools/citation-manager/README.md
# Output: 736

wc -l tools/citation-manager/design-docs/Architecture.md
# Output: 644

ls tools/citation-manager/design-docs/features/250919-auto-fix-short-file-names/*.md | wc -l
# Output: 9
```

**Status**: PASS - All documentation migrated to correct locations with proper hierarchy

### Git History Preservation Validation - PASS

**Git Status Analysis**:
- Total Renamed Operations: 14 files (all migrations)
- Staged for Commit: Yes
- Add/Delete Operations: 0 (confirms proper git mv usage)
- Content Changes: 0 insertions, 0 deletions across all files

**Git Diff Validation**:
```bash
git diff --staged --numstat
# All files show: 0	0	{old_path => new_path}
# Confirms zero content modifications
```

**Git History Tracking**:
- All operations using `git mv` ensure history preservation
- Git status confirms "renamed" operations (not "added"/"deleted")
- When committed, `git log --follow` will track full file history

**Status**: PASS - Git history preservation confirmed through proper rename operations

### Directory Structure Validation - PASS

**Task T1: Directory Structure Creation**:
```bash
ls -ld tools/citation-manager/ tools/citation-manager/src/ tools/citation-manager/design-docs/ tools/citation-manager/design-docs/features/
# All 4 directories exist with proper permissions
```

**Directories Verified**:
- `tools/citation-manager/` (root directory)
- `tools/citation-manager/src/` (source files)
- `tools/citation-manager/design-docs/` (architecture documentation)
- `tools/citation-manager/design-docs/features/` (historical features)

**Status**: PASS - Complete directory hierarchy established

### File Migration Validation Summary

| Task | Files | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| T1: Directory Structure | Directories | 4 | 4 | PASS |
| T2: Source Files | .js files | 4 | 4 | PASS |
| T3: README | README.md (736 lines) | 1 | 1 | PASS |
| T4: Architecture | Architecture.md (644 lines) | 1 | 1 | PASS |
| T5: Historical Docs | Feature .md files | 9 | 9 | PASS |

**Total Files Migrated**: 14 files (4 source + 1 README + 1 Architecture + 9 historical docs)
**Total Operations**: All staged as "renamed" with 0 content changes

### Recommendations

1. **Commit Readiness**: All migrations staged and validated - ready for commit
2. **Legacy Cleanup**: As documented in story, legacy location cleanup deferred to Story 1.4 for safety
3. **Next Steps**:
   - Proceed to Story 1.3 for executable configuration and import path updates
   - Story 1.4 will migrate tests and perform final legacy cleanup
4. **Architecture Alignment**: Migration follows Tool/Package Documentation Organization pattern established in Story 1.1

### Issues Discovered

**None** - All acceptance criteria met with zero issues

### Overall Assessment

User Story 1.2 has successfully completed all migration objectives:
- All source files relocated to workspace structure
- All documentation migrated with proper hierarchy
- Git history preserved through proper `git mv` operations
- File contents unchanged (0 insertions/0 deletions)
- Ready for commit and progression to Story 1.3
