# Task 8: Update Architecture Documentation - Technical Task 4.1

## Core Problem

- **Current State**: ADR-006 shows CommonJS as decided, no record of ESM migration decision
- **Required State**: ADR-006 marked as "Superseded" and new ADR-007 documenting ESM adoption
- **Integration Requirement**: Architecture documentation must reflect completed migration as new standard

## Implementation Requirements

**Files**:
- `design-docs/features/version-based-analysis/version-based-analysis-architecture.md` (modify)

**Transformation Pattern**:

```markdown
// Current pattern:
### ADR-006: Module System Selection (CommonJS vs ES6)
- **Status**: Decided

// Target pattern:
### ADR-006: Module System Selection (CommonJS vs ES6)
- **Status**: Superseded by ADR-007

### ADR-007: Migration to ES Modules
- **Status**: Decided
```

**Critical Rules**:
- Mark ADR-006 status as "Superseded by ADR-007"
- Create new ADR-007 with proper date, context, decision, and consequences
- Follow existing ADR format and structure

## Key Implementation Elements

1. **ADR-006 Update**: Change status from "Decided" to "Superseded by ADR-007"
2. **ADR-007 Creation**: Add new ADR documenting the migration decision and rationale
3. **Technical Context**: Document that migration was completed before significant new code development

## Expected Outcome

```markdown
// Before:
### ADR-006: Module System Selection (CommonJS vs ES6)
- **Status**: Decided
- **Date**: 2025-09-18

// After:
### ADR-006: Module System Selection (CommonJS vs ES6)
- **Status**: Superseded by ADR-007
- **Date**: 2025-09-18

### ADR-007: Migration to ES Modules
- **Status**: Decided
- **Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Context**: [migration rationale and timing]
- **Decision**: [ESM adoption decision]
- **Consequences**: [positive and negative impacts]
```

## Immediate Validation

```bash
grep -A 5 "ADR-006" design-docs/features/version-based-analysis/version-based-analysis-architecture.md
grep -A 10 "ADR-007" design-docs/features/version-based-analysis/version-based-analysis-architecture.md
# Expected result: ADR-006 shows "Superseded" status, ADR-007 exists with complete content
```

## Integration Note

Architecture documentation update captures the completed migration as an architectural decision, establishing ESM as the new standard for future development. Can be done in parallel with final application script conversions.
