# Story 1.1: Version Detection and Directory Scaffolding

**Critial LLM Initialization Instructions**: When first reading this file, you MUST IMMEDIATELY run citation manager to extract base paths: `npm run citation:base-paths <this-file-path> -- --format json`. Read ALL discovered base path files to gather complete architectural context before proceeding.

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** Technical PM,
**I want** the system to automatically detect the binary's version and create a corresponding versioned directory,
**so that** analysis artifacts are organized systematically without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `Code Processing Application` starts, THEN the system SHALL extract the version number from the source binary. ^US1-1AC1
2. IF a directory for the extracted version does not exist, THEN the system shall create it. ^US1-1AC2
3. IF version detection fails, THEN the system SHALL log the failure AND create a new directory using a unique identifier. ^US1-1AC3
4. The system SHALL ensure the directory creation process is atomic. ^US1-1AC4
5. The system SHALL log all automation steps to support troubleshooting. ^US1-1AC5

#### TDD Workflow Notes

**Each TDD Cycle Follows:**
1. **RED**: Write failing test that captures requirement
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve implementation without breaking tests

**Key TDD Principles:**
- **Tests Define Behavior**: Tests are written before implementation
- **Minimal Implementation**: Write only enough code to pass tests
- **Continuous Validation**: Run tests after every change
- **Refactor Safely**: Improve code while maintaining passing tests

**Validation Strategy:**
- Each task produces either failing tests (RED) or passing tests (GREEN)
- Implementation files only created after corresponding tests exist
- All architectural constraints validated through test requirements

## Dev Notes

### Architectural Context (C4)

- **Components Affected**:
  - [`Code Processing Application.SetupOrchestrator`](../../version-based-analysis-architecture.md#==**Code%20Processing%20Application.SetupOrchestrator**==)
  - [`Code Processing Application.DirectoryManager`](../../version-based-analysis-architecture.md#==**Code%20Processing%20Application.DirectoryManager**==)
- **Implementation Guides**:
  - [SetupOrchestrator Implementation](../../verson-based-analysis-components-implementation-guide.md.md#`setupOrchestrator.js`) - Main orchestration entry point for automated pre-processing workflow
  - [DirectoryManager Implementation](../../verson-based-analysis-components-implementation-guide.md.md#`directoryManager.js`) - Directory lifecycle management with rollback capabilities

### Technical Details

- **File Locations**:
  - Primary component: `src/scripts/setupOrchestrator.js` (PROPOSED)
  - Helper component: `src/scripts/pre-process/directoryManager.js` (PROPOSED)
- **Technology Stack**: [Node.js ≥18](../../version-based-analysis-architecture.md#Technology%20Stack), ES6 Classes (following implementation guides)
- **Dependencies**: `child_process`, `fs`, `path`, shared logger component
- **Technical Constraints**:
  - ES6 class architecture (per implementation guides)
  - [All logging must use shared logger.js](../../version-based-analysis-architecture.md#Critical%20Integration%20Rules)
  - [Atomic operations required for directory management](../../verson-based-analysis-components-implementation-guide.md.md#%60DirectoryManager%60%20Core%20Logic%20%28Pseudocode%29)
  - Dependency injection pattern for testability

### Design Principles Adherence

This story must adhere to the following [Design Principles](../../../../Design%20Principles.md):

**Critical Principles:**
- [**Atomic Operations**](../../../../Design%20Principles.md#^atomic-operations) (Safety-First): Directory creation process must be atomic with complete rollback on failure
- [**Dependency Abstraction**](../../../../Design%20Principles.md#^dependency-abstraction) (Modular): Components depend on abstractions (interfaces) not concrete implementations
- [**Fail Fast**](../../../../Design%20Principles.md#^fail-fast) (Safety-First): Version detection failures should be caught early with clear error messages
- [**Single File Responsibility**](../../../../Design%20Principles.md#^single-file-responsibility) (Modular): Each component handles one specific concern
- [**Clear Contracts**](../../../../Design%20Principles.md#^clear-contracts) (Safety-First): Specify preconditions/postconditions between SetupOrchestrator and DirectoryManager
- [**One Source of Truth**](../../../../Design%20Principles.md#^one-source-of-truth) (Quick Heuristics): Version information has single authoritative source

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- [**Hidden Global State**](../../../../Design%20Principles.md#^hidden-global-state): Keep all state explicit in component constructors and method parameters
- [**Code-Enforced Invariants**](../../../../Design%20Principles.md#^code-enforced-invariants): Directory structure validation should be in data layer, not scattered checks
- [**Branch Explosion**](../../../../Design%20Principles.md#^branch-explosion): Use simple, linear logic for version parsing rather than complex conditional trees

**Implementation Guidance:**
- Version parsing logic must be deterministic and predictable
- Error recovery must be graceful with meaningful context
- Component interfaces must be testable through dependency injection

### Previous Story Insights
- No previous stories - this is the first story in Epic 1

### Testing

- **Test Framework**: [Vitest](../../version-based-analysis-architecture.md#Technology%20Stack) - modern, high-performance framework with Jest-compatible API
- **Test Strategy**:
  - [Integration-Driven Development, MVP-Focused, Real Systems, Fake Fixtures](../../version-based-analysis-architecture.md#Testing%20Strategy)
  - [Real file system interactions with isolated temporary environments](../../verson-based-analysis-components-implementation-guide.md.md#Testing%20Architecture)
- **Test Location**: Tests should be created alongside implementation files following project conventions

#### Required Test Implementation

##### 1. Primary Integration Test (Happy Path)
- **Purpose**: Verify that when a version is detected, the correct directory is created
- **Steps**:
  1. Set up lightweight mock `claude` binary to output version "1.2.3"
  2. Run the `SetupOrchestrator`
  3. **Assert** that directory `/v1.2.3/` exists (verifies AC1, AC2)
  4. **Assert** that log contains successful version detection messages (verifies AC5)

##### 2. Failure Case Integration Test
- **Purpose**: Verify system handles version detection failure gracefully
- **Steps**:
  1. Set up mock `claude` binary to fail or produce no version output
  2. Run the `SetupOrchestrator`
  3. **Assert** that directory with unique identifier was created (verifies AC3)
  4. **Assert** that log contains warning about failed detection

##### 3. Focused Test (DirectoryManager Atomicity)
- **Purpose**: Verify atomicity and rollback functionality of `DirectoryManager`
- **Steps**:
  1. Call `DirectoryManager` functions directly
  2. Test create-and-rollback logic in isolation against real temporary directory
  3. **Assert** atomic operations and rollback behavior (verifies AC4, NFR5)

#### Mock Binary Implementation Details

**Testing Approach**: The "mock `claude` binary" refers to creating a fake executable named `claude` with PATH manipulation:

**1. Binary Creation:**
- Create shell script (Unix) or batch file (Windows) named `claude`
- Script responds to `claude --version` command interface
- Returns version string like "1.2.3" to stdout for success scenarios

**2. PATH Integration:**
- Temporarily add script directory to system PATH during test
- Ensures `which claude` command finds the fake binary
- Restore original PATH after test cleanup

**3. Error Simulation:**
- Exit code failures: Script returns non-zero exit code
- No version output: Script returns empty string or unrelated text
- Permission errors: Script lacks execute permissions

_Reference_: [Testing Strategy Example](../../enhancement-scope/Testing%20Strategy%20Example.md) - Complete implementation details

### Agent Workflow Sequence
