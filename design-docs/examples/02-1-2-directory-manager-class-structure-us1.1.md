# DirectoryManager Class Structure Implementation Details

## Implementation Gap

- **Objective**: Create minimal DirectoryManager class with ES modules exports and dependency injection constructor to pass interface tests
- **Current State**: Interface test exists in `test/directoryManager.test.js` that fails with module import error (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`) because DirectoryManager class doesn't exist
- **Required State**: Working DirectoryManager class file with basic structure that passes interface validation tests from Task 2.1.1
- **Integration Requirement**: Implementation must satisfy the exact interface contract defined by the failing tests while following ES modules patterns and dependency injection architecture

## Background Context

The DirectoryManager class is a core component in the version detection workflow that handles atomic directory creation and rollback operations. Task 2.1.1 created comprehensive interface tests that define the exact contract this implementation must satisfy.

**Interface Contract from Task 2.1.1:**
- Constructor signature: `DirectoryManager(fs, path, logger, config)`
- Public methods: `createVersionDirectory(version)` and `rollbackDirectory(path)`
- Dependency injection pattern for all file system and logging operations
- ES modules export structure

The tests are currently failing with import errors, establishing the TDD Red phase. This task transitions to Green by creating the minimal implementation that passes all interface tests.

### Context Gathering Steps

1. **Review interface test requirements:**
   Read `test/directoryManager.test.js` to understand the exact interface contract that must be satisfied, including constructor parameters and method signatures

2. **Understand architectural patterns:**
   Review the implementation guide pseudocode at `design-docs/features/version-based-analysis/verson-based-analysis-components-implementation-guide.md.md` for DirectoryManager architectural guidance

3. **Validate current test state:**
   Run the interface tests to confirm they fail with import errors:
   ```bash
   npm test test/directoryManager.test.js
   ```

4. **Review dependency injection patterns:**
   Check `src/scripts/logger.js` to understand existing logging patterns that should be followed for consistency

## Implementation Requirements

### Files
- `src/scripts/pre-process/directoryManager.js` (create)

### Change Patterns

**TDD Green phase implementation scenario:**
1. Create ES modules class that can be imported successfully
2. Implement constructor that accepts fs, path, logger, config parameters via dependency injection
3. Add method stubs for `createVersionDirectory()` and `rollbackDirectory()` that satisfy interface tests
4. Ensure all interface validation tests pass without implementing actual functionality yet

```javascript
// Target Pattern: Minimal class structure to pass interface tests
import { validateDependencies } from '../utils/validation.js'; // if exists

export class DirectoryManager {
  constructor(fs, path, logger, config) {
    // Validation: Constructor requires all four dependencies
    if (!fs || !path || !logger || !config) {
      throw new Error('DirectoryManager requires fs, path, logger, and config dependencies');
    }

    // Integration: Store injected dependencies for use by methods
    this.fs = fs;
    this.path = path;
    this.logger = logger;
    this.config = config;

    // Boundary: Initialize any required internal state
    this.initialized = true;
  }

  // Method stub: Returns version directory path without implementation
  createVersionDirectory(version) {
    // Validation: Method accepts version parameter and doesn't throw
    if (!version) {
      throw new Error('Version parameter is required');
    }

    // Placeholder: Return expected format for interface validation
    return this.path.join(this.config.basePath, `v${version}`);
  }

  // Method stub: Accepts path parameter without implementation
  rollbackDirectory(path) {
    // Validation: Method accepts path parameter and doesn't throw
    if (!path) {
      throw new Error('Path parameter is required');
    }

    // Placeholder: Method exists and is callable
    return;
  }
}
// Integration: ES modules export enables import from test files
// Validation: Interface tests transition from Red (failing) to Green (passing)
// Boundary: Minimal implementation focuses only on interface satisfaction
```

### Critical Rules
- Implementation must pass ALL interface tests from Task 2.1.1 without implementing actual directory operations
- Use dependency injection pattern - no direct imports of fs, path, or logger modules
- Follow ES modules export pattern with explicit file extensions in imports

## Key Implementation Elements

1. **Primary Change**: Create DirectoryManager class with dependency injection constructor and method stubs to satisfy interface contract
2. **Integration Points**: ES modules export structure, dependency injection pattern, error handling for missing parameters
3. **Validation Strategy**: All interface tests from Task 2.1.1 pass, confirming TDD Green phase transition

### Expected Outcome

**Output**: Working DirectoryManager class file with basic structure that passes interface validation tests
**Scope**:
- DirectoryManager class with ES modules export
- Constructor with dependency injection (fs, path, logger, config)
- Method stubs for `createVersionDirectory()` and `rollbackDirectory()`
- Parameter validation for constructor and methods
- Error handling for missing dependencies

**Success Criteria**: All interface tests from Task 2.1.1 pass, confirming successful TDD Red to Green transition

## Immediate Validation

```bash
npm test test/directoryManager.test.js
# Expected result: All interface tests pass, no import errors, methods are callable
```

## Integration Note

This implementation creates the minimal class structure needed for the interface tests to pass, establishing the TDD Green phase. Future tasks will add actual directory creation and rollback functionality while maintaining this interface contract. The dependency injection pattern ensures the class remains testable as functionality is added.
