Telling Claude to optimize for "LLM use not human use" is like asking someone to "make it more computery" - it's meaningless and makes bloated docs. You didn't mention any criteria. A first improvement is to define what you want.

# Create a context document optimized for token efficiency with these constraints:

- Maximum token budget: 1500 tokens

- Priority: Information I'll reference repeatedly over next 2 weeks

- Format: Bullet points, tables, and short sections only

- Content focus: Actionable details that affect current decisions

- Eliminate: Redundant explanations, background fluff, hedge words

- Success metric: I can find any needed detail in under 10 seconds

- Structure: Status → Current priorities → Key constraints → Minimal context

But to be honest, I wouldn't use that either, because what is redundant, what is detail what is focus??

So the best prompt would be something like this. I didn't came up with it. I asked via a prompt Claude to ask the prompt (can't post it here yet, new user)
