**Been an avid Claude Code user since the experimental rollout in Feb, and won the Anthropic x Forum Ventures hackathon with [zenith.chat](https://zenith.chat/) alongside [@DRodriguezFX](https://x.com/DRodriguezFX) - completely using Claude Code.**

Here's my complete setup after 10 months of daily use: skills, hooks, subagents, MCPs, plugins, and what actually works.

---

## Skills and Commands

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#skills-and-commands)

Skills operate like rules, constricted to certain scopes and workflows. They're shorthand to prompts when you need to execute a particular workflow.

After a long session of coding with Opus 4.5, you want to clean out dead code and loose .md files? Run `/refactor-clean`. Need testing? `/tdd`, `/e2e`, `/test-coverage`. Skills can also include codemaps - a way for Claude to quickly navigate your codebase without burning context on exploration.

[![Terminal showing chained commands](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/raw/main/assets/images/shortform/02-chaining-commands.jpeg)](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/assets/images/shortform/02-chaining-commands.jpeg)_Chaining commands together_

Commands are skills executed via slash commands. They overlap but are stored differently:

- **Skills**: `~/.claude/skills/` - broader workflow definitions
- **Commands**: `~/.claude/commands/` - quick executable prompts

```shell
# Example skill structure
~/.claude/skills/
  pmx-guidelines.md      # Project-specific patterns
  coding-standards.md    # Language best practices
  tdd-workflow/          # Multi-file skill with README.md
  security-review/       # Checklist-based skill
```

---

## Hooks

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#hooks)

Hooks are trigger-based automations that fire on specific events. Unlike skills, they're constricted to tool calls and lifecycle events.

**Hook Types:**

1. **PreToolUse** - Before a tool executes (validation, reminders)
2. **PostToolUse** - After a tool finishes (formatting, feedback loops)
3. **UserPromptSubmit** - When you send a message
4. **Stop** - When Claude finishes responding
5. **PreCompact** - Before context compaction
6. **Notification** - Permission requests

**Example: tmux reminder before long-running commands**

```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "tool == \"Bash\" && tool_input.command matches \"(npm|pnpm|yarn|cargo|pytest)\"",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "if [ -z \"$TMUX\" ]; then echo '[Hook] Consider tmux for session persistence' >&2; fi"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

[![PostToolUse hook feedback](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/raw/main/assets/images/shortform/03-posttooluse-hook.png)](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/assets/images/shortform/03-posttooluse-hook.png)_Example of what feedback you get in Claude Code, while running a PostToolUse hook_

**Pro tip:** Use the `hookify` plugin to create hooks conversationally instead of writing JSON manually. Run `/hookify` and describe what you want.

---

## Subagents

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#subagents)

Subagents are processes your orchestrator (main Claude) can delegate tasks to with limited scopes. They can run in background or foreground, freeing up context for the main agent.

Subagents work nicely with skills - a subagent capable of executing a subset of your skills can be delegated tasks and use those skills autonomously. They can also be sandboxed with specific tool permissions.

```shell
# Example subagent structure
~/.claude/agents/
  planner.md           # Feature implementation planning
  architect.md         # System design decisions
  tdd-guide.md         # Test-driven development
  code-reviewer.md     # Quality/security review
  security-reviewer.md # Vulnerability analysis
  build-error-resolver.md
  e2e-runner.md
  refactor-cleaner.md
```

Configure allowed tools, MCPs, and permissions per subagent for proper scoping.

---

## Rules and Memory

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#rules-and-memory)

Your `.rules` folder holds `.md` files with best practices Claude should ALWAYS follow. Two approaches:

1. **Single CLAUDE.md** - Everything in one file (user or project level)
2. **Rules folder** - Modular `.md` files grouped by concern

```shell
~/.claude/rules/
  security.md      # No hardcoded secrets, validate inputs
  coding-style.md  # Immutability, file organization
  testing.md       # TDD workflow, 80% coverage
  git-workflow.md  # Commit format, PR process
  agents.md        # When to delegate to subagents
  performance.md   # Model selection, context management
```

**Example rules:**

- No emojis in codebase
- Refrain from purple hues in frontend
- Always test code before deployment
- Prioritize modular code over mega-files
- Never commit console.logs

---

## MCPs (Model Context Protocol)

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#mcps-model-context-protocol)

MCPs connect Claude to external services directly. Not a replacement for APIs - it's a prompt-driven wrapper around them, allowing more flexibility in navigating information.

**Example:** Supabase MCP lets Claude pull specific data, run SQL directly upstream without copy-paste. Same for databases, deployment platforms, etc.

[![Supabase MCP listing tables](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/raw/main/assets/images/shortform/04-supabase-mcp.jpeg)](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/assets/images/shortform/04-supabase-mcp.jpeg)_Example of the Supabase MCP listing the tables within the public schema_

**Chrome in Claude:** is a built-in plugin MCP that lets Claude autonomously control your browser - clicking around to see how things work.

**CRITICAL: Context Window Management**

Be picky with MCPs. I keep all MCPs in user config but **disable everything unused**. Navigate to `/plugins` and scroll down or run `/mcp`.

[![/plugins interface](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/raw/main/assets/images/shortform/05-plugins-interface.jpeg)](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/assets/images/shortform/05-plugins-interface.jpeg)_Using /plugins to navigate to MCPs to see which ones are currently installed and their status_

Your 200k context window before compacting might only be 70k with too many tools enabled. Performance degrades significantly.

**Rule of thumb:** Have 20-30 MCPs in config, but keep under 10 enabled / under 80 tools active.

```shell
# Check enabled MCPs
/mcp

# Disable unused ones in ~/.claude.json under projects.disabledMcpServers
```

---

## Plugins

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#plugins)

Plugins package tools for easy installation instead of tedious manual setup. A plugin can be a skill + MCP combined, or hooks/tools bundled together.

**Installing plugins:**

```shell
# Add a marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/mixedbread-ai/mgrep

# Open Claude, run /plugins, find new marketplace, install from there
```

[![Marketplaces tab showing mgrep](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/raw/main/assets/images/shortform/06-marketplaces-mgrep.jpeg)](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/assets/images/shortform/06-marketplaces-mgrep.jpeg)_Displaying the newly installed Mixedbread-Grep marketplace_

**LSP Plugins** are particularly useful if you run Claude Code outside editors frequently. Language Server Protocol gives Claude real-time type checking, go-to-definition, and intelligent completions without needing an IDE open.

```shell
# Enabled plugins example
typescript-lsp@claude-plugins-official  # TypeScript intelligence
pyright-lsp@claude-plugins-official     # Python type checking
hookify@claude-plugins-official         # Create hooks conversationally
mgrep@Mixedbread-Grep                   # Better search than ripgrep
```

Same warning as MCPs - watch your context window.

## Tips and Tricks

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#tips-and-tricks)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#keyboard-shortcuts)

- `Ctrl+U` - Delete entire line (faster than backspace spam)
- `!` - Quick bash command prefix
- `@` - Search for files
- `/` - Initiate slash commands
- `Shift+Enter` - Multi-line input
- `Tab` - Toggle thinking display
- `Esc Esc` - Interrupt Claude / restore code

### Parallel Workflows

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#parallel-workflows)

- **Fork** (`/fork`) - Fork conversations to do non-overlapping tasks in parallel instead of spamming queued messages
- **Git Worktrees** - For overlapping parallel Claudes without conflicts. Each worktree is an independent checkout

```shell
git worktree add ../feature-branch feature-branch
# Now run separate Claude instances in each worktree
```

### tmux for Long-Running Commands

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#tmux-for-long-running-commands)

Stream and watch logs/bash processes Claude runs:

[https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/shortform/07-tmux-video.mp4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/shortform/07-tmux-video.mp4)

```shell
tmux new -s dev
# Claude runs commands here, you can detach and reattach
tmux attach -t dev
```

### mgrep > grep

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#mgrep--grep)

`mgrep` is a significant improvement from ripgrep/grep. Install via plugin marketplace, then use the `/mgrep` skill. Works with both local search and web search.

```shell
mgrep "function handleSubmit"  # Local search
mgrep --web "Next.js 15 app router changes"  # Web search
```

### Other Useful Commands

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#other-useful-commands)

- `/rewind` - Go back to a previous state
- `/statusline` - Customize with branch, context %, todos
- `/checkpoints` - File-level undo points
- `/compact` - Manually trigger context compaction

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#github-actions-cicd)

Set up code review on your PRs with GitHub Actions. Claude can review PRs automatically when configured.

[![Claude bot approving a PR](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/raw/main/assets/images/shortform/08-github-pr-review.jpeg)](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/assets/images/shortform/08-github-pr-review.jpeg)_Claude approving a bug fix PR_

### Sandboxing

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#sandboxing)

Use sandbox mode for risky operations - Claude runs in restricted environment without affecting your actual system.

---

## On Editors

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#on-editors)

Your editor choice significantly impacts Claude Code workflow. While Claude Code works from any terminal, pairing it with a capable editor unlocks real-time file tracking, quick navigation, and integrated command execution.

### Zed (My Preference)

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#zed-my-preference)

I use [Zed](https://zed.dev/) - written in Rust, so it's genuinely fast. Opens instantly, handles massive codebases without breaking a sweat, and barely touches system resources.

**Why Zed + Claude Code is a great combo:**

- **Speed** - Rust-based performance means no lag when Claude is rapidly editing files. Your editor keeps up
- **Agent Panel Integration** - Zed's Claude integration lets you track file changes in real-time as Claude edits. Jump between files Claude references without leaving the editor
- **CMD+Shift+R Command Palette** - Quick access to all your custom slash commands, debuggers, build scripts in a searchable UI
- **Minimal Resource Usage** - Won't compete with Claude for RAM/CPU during heavy operations. Important when running Opus
- **Vim Mode** - Full vim keybindings if that's your thing

[![Zed Editor with custom commands](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/raw/main/assets/images/shortform/09-zed-editor.jpeg)](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/assets/images/shortform/09-zed-editor.jpeg)_Zed Editor with custom commands dropdown using CMD+Shift+R. Following mode shown as the bullseye in the bottom right._

**Editor-Agnostic Tips:**

1. **Split your screen** - Terminal with Claude Code on one side, editor on the other
2. **Ctrl + G** - quickly open the file Claude is currently working on in Zed
3. **Auto-save** - Enable autosave so Claude's file reads are always current
4. **Git integration** - Use editor's git features to review Claude's changes before committing
5. **File watchers** - Most editors auto-reload changed files, verify this is enabled

### VSCode / Cursor

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#vscode--cursor)

This is also a viable choice and works well with Claude Code. You can use it in either terminal format, with automatic sync with your editor using `\ide` enabling LSP functionality (somewhat redundant with plugins now). Or you can opt for the extension which is more integrated with the Editor and has a matching UI.

[![VS Code Claude Code Extension](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/raw/main/assets/images/shortform/10-vscode-extension.jpeg)](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/blob/main/assets/images/shortform/10-vscode-extension.jpeg)_The VS Code extension provides a native graphical interface for Claude Code, integrated directly into your IDE._

```

### MCP Servers

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#mcp-servers)

**Configured (User Level):**

```json
{
  "github": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"] },
  "firecrawl": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"] },
  "supabase": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest", "--project-ref=YOUR_REF"]
  },
  "memory": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"] },
  "sequential-thinking": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
  },
  "vercel": { "type": "http", "url": "https://mcp.vercel.com" },
  "railway": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@railway/mcp-server"] },
  "cloudflare-docs": { "type": "http", "url": "https://docs.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp" },
  "cloudflare-workers-bindings": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://bindings.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp"
  },
  "clickhouse": { "type": "http", "url": "https://mcp.clickhouse.cloud/mcp" },
  "AbletonMCP": { "command": "uvx", "args": ["ableton-mcp"] },
  "magic": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@magicuidesign/mcp@latest"] }
}
```

This is the key - I have 14 MCPs configured but only ~5-6 enabled per project. Keeps context window healthy.

### Key Hooks

## Key Takeaways

[](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main#key-takeaways)

1. **Don't overcomplicate** - treat configuration like fine-tuning, not architecture
2. **Context window is precious** - disable unused MCPs and plugins
3. **Parallel execution** - fork conversations, use git worktrees
4. **Automate the repetitive** - hooks for formatting, linting, reminders
5. **Scope your subagents** - limited tools = focused execution
