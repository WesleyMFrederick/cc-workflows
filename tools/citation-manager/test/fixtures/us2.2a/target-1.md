# Target Document 1 - Content Repository

This document contains various sections for comprehensive deduplication testing.

## Section A - Frequently Referenced

This is Section A content that will be extracted multiple times by different links.
It contains substantial text to make deduplication meaningful and measurable.

The content includes important information that multiple sources want to reference:

- Key concept number one with detailed explanation
- Key concept number two with supporting evidence
- Key concept number three to complete the picture

This section is designed to test duplicate detection across multiple references.

## Section B - Unique Content

This is Section B with completely different content from Section A.
It will only be referenced once, testing that unique content is properly handled.

The deduplication system should store this separately from Section A:

- Different topic area with distinct information
- Separate analysis and conclusions
- Independent reference material

## Section C - Another Duplicate Target

Section C contains another block of content that will be referenced multiple times.
This tests that the system can handle multiple different duplicated sections.

Important details in this section:

1. First important point about the topic
2. Second critical observation
3. Third key takeaway for readers

This allows testing multiple concurrent deduplication streams.
