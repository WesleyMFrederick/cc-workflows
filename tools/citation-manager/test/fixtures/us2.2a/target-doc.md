# Target Document for Deduplication Testing

This document contains content that will be extracted multiple times to test deduplication.

## Shared Section

This is the shared content that will be extracted by multiple links.
It contains several paragraphs to make the content substantial enough for testing.

**Important details:**

- First key point about the topic
- Second key point with more information
- Third key point to round out the section

This content should only be stored once in the extractedContentBlocks,
even though multiple links will reference it.

## Other Section

This is a different section that won't be used in deduplication testing.
