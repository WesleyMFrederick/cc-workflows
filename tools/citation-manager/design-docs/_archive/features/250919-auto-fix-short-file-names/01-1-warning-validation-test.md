# Warning Validation Test Implementation Details

## Implementation Gap

- **Objective**: Create test that validates short filename citations return "warning" status when resolving cross-directory via file cache
- **Current State**: CitationValidator returns only "valid" or "error" status. Cross-directory short filename citations that resolve via file cache are marked as "valid"
- **Required State**: Cross-directory short filename citations must trigger "warning" status and be displayed in distinct warning section
- **Integration Requirement**: Test must follow existing Node.js test runner patterns while preparing for warning status implementation in CitationValidator

## Background Context
Citation manager is located at `citation-manager.js` in the citation-links root directory. Tests execute it via Node.js with command pattern:

```bash
node citation-manager.js validate <file> --scope <folder> [--format json]
```

File cache functionality enables smart filename resolution - when `--scope` is provided, the tool scans all markdown files in the scope folder and can resolve short filenames like `target.md` even when the citation path is `../missing/target.md`. Currently these cross-directory resolutions are marked as "valid" but should be "warning" status.

### Context Gathering Steps

1. **Understand test/ folder structure:**
   Explore the test/ folder structure at `./agentic-workflows/utility-scripts/citation-links/test/` to understand existing test patterns and fixture organization

2. **Read key files:**
   - `test/validation.test.js` - Core test patterns
   - `test/story-validation.test.js` - Scope usage examples
   - `test/fixtures/scope-test.md` - Cross-directory test scenario
   - `citation-manager.js` - CLI interface understanding

3. **Test current behavior:**

   ```bash
   node citation-manager.js validate test/fixtures/scope-test.md --scope test/fixtures --format json
   ```

4. **Run existing tests to understand patterns:**

   ```bash
   node --test test/validation.test.js
   ```

## Implementation Requirements

### Files
- `test/warning-validation.test.js` (create)
- `test/fixtures/warning-test-source.md` (create)
- `test/fixtures/subdir/warning-test-target.md` (create)

### Change Patterns

**Warning scenario example:**
1. Source file: `test/fixtures/warning-source.md` contains citation `[Link](../wrong-path/target.md)`
2. Actual target file exists at: `test/fixtures/subdir/target.md`
3. Citation path `../wrong-path/target.md` is broken (wrong-path doesn't exist)
4. But file cache finds `target.md` in `subdir/` and resolves the citation as "valid"
5. **Should be**: Citation marked as "warning" because path is incorrect despite successful resolution

```javascript
// Current validation pattern: binary valid/error status
const result = JSON.parse(output);
assert(result.results.filter(r => r.status === "valid").length > 0);
assert(result.results.filter(r => r.status === "error").length > 0);

// Target pattern: three-tier status validation with warning detection
const result = JSON.parse(output);
field warningResults = result.results.filter(r => r.status === "warning")
field validResults = result.results.filter(r => r.status === "valid")
field errorResults = result.results.filter(r => r.status === "error")
// Integration: Warning status for cross-directory short filename citations resolved via file cache
// Validation: CLI output contains distinct warning section markup
// Boundary: JSON structure maintains compatibility while extending status enum
```

### Critical Rules
- Test must fail initially since "warning" status doesn't exist yet - validates test detects the gap
- Use existing file cache scope functionality to trigger cross-directory resolution scenario

## Key Implementation Elements

1. **Primary Change**: Create test fixture with cross-directory short filename citation, validate warning status detection
2. **Integration Points**: Leverages existing execSync testing pattern, file cache scope functionality, CLI/JSON output validation
3. **Validation Strategy**: Test both CLI warning section display and JSON warning status field

## Expected Outcome

**Output**: Test file validating warning status for cross-directory short filename citations
**Scope**:
- Test fixture demonstrating cross-directory short filename resolution via file cache
- CLI output validation for warning section display
- JSON output validation for warning status field
- Integration with existing scope/file cache functionality

**Success Criteria**: Test fails initially proving it detects missing warning functionality, then passes after warning implementation

## Immediate Validation

```bash
node --test test/warning-validation.test.js
# Expected result: Test fails with assertion error about missing warning status/section
```

## Integration Note

This test establishes validation criteria for warning status implementation. When warning detection is implemented in CitationValidator, this test transitions from failing to passing, confirming functionality works correctly.

## Task 1.1 Implement Agent Notes

### Agent Model Used
- Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- Test Writer Agent with TDD expertise and integration-first philosophy

### Debug Log References
- Initial scope-test validation showed file cache resolving `../missing/test-target.md` as "valid"
- Warning test fixture validation confirmed cross-directory resolution via file cache working as expected
- Test execution shows 3 failing tests as designed - detecting missing "warning" status functionality

### Completion Notes List
- Successfully created test that validates expected warning behavior for cross-directory short filename citations
- Test fixtures demonstrate the exact scenario: wrong path `../wrong-path/warning-test-target.md` resolves to actual file `subdir/warning-test-target.md` via file cache
- Current validation marks this as "valid" but test expects "warning" - exactly as specified in implementation requirements
- Test fails initially as designed, proving it detects the missing warning functionality gap
- All test patterns follow existing Node.js test runner conventions with execSync and JSON validation
- Integration with existing scope/file cache functionality confirmed working
