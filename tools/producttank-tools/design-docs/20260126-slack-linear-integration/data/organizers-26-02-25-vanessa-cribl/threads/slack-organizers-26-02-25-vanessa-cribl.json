Let me know what you need from me to gauge if Vanessa would be a good speaker on a topic we would be interested in. Once we know we want to go in that direction and have a rough sense of the date, we can engage Cribl via the slack channel.\n\nLet me know if you have questions\n\nU08UZM1P90R - another automation opportunity - pre-populating the channels for events of the year to hold space for conversation and scouting",

In my experience in Product orgs, people can get myopic and focused on output or locally optimized outcomes. A discussion on strategy would help build that drill up skill, and also open up product people to more engaging discussions with executives and leadership. \n\nAI can be used a thought partner for exploring strategy, and guardrail to warn when prod teams are building features that dont align with strategy.\n\nAlso, how can product people speak upwards to leadership when what they are seeing on the ground doesnt seem to align with strategy.",
