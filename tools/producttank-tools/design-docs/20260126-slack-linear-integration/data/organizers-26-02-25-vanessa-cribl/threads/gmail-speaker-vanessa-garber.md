  Full speaker coordination thread from initial intro through slide review scheduling.
  Covers Glenn Block's introduction of Vanessa to the organizing team, scheduling of
  pre-talk call, speaker form submission, venue date confirmation (Feb 25), date typo
  correction on meetup page, slide deck deadline (2/11), and slide review meeting
  scheduling (2/12 at 1:30PM).
summary: >
  Glenn Block introduced Vanessa Garber to the ProductTank SF organizing team in July 2025.
  After several rounds of scheduling, Karsh held an initial call with Vanessa in December 2025
  to discuss topics. The team selected "Strategic Focus" and Melissa coordinated talk
  development. Betty confirmed the Feb 25 date with Cribl. A date typo on the meetup page
  was caught by Vanessa and corrected quickly. Slides are due 2/11 with a review meeting
  set for 2/12 at 1:30PM with Melissa, Vanessa, and Wesley.
