subject: Mixpanel <> ProductTank SF January Sponsorship
event: ProductTank SF - January 2026 / April 2026
event_date: 2026-01-21
speaker: Dan Olsen
venue: Mixpanel (attempted) / Cribl (actual January) / Mixpanel (April TBD)
description: |
  Full sponsorship coordination thread covering the Mixpanel partnership from initial outreach through pivot to April. Originally scoped as a January venue + F&B sponsor, Mixpanel was unable to host on 1/21 due to 30-day notice policy and then withdrew from January entirely citing leadership and product team changes. Thread tracks budget negotiation ($2.5k committed), venue logistics questions, date flexibility discussions, Betty's attempt to retain financial sponsorship for January at an alternate venue, Kalina Bryant's request for a formal proposal, and the eventual agreement to sponsor an April event. Ends with Melissa forwarding Karsh's sponsor proposal template to the internal team requesting someone draft the Mixpanel proposal.
summary: Karsh initiated the Mixpanel sponsorship outreach on Dec 2, 2025, proposing a January event with Dan Olsen at the Mixpanel office on Embarcadero. Kara Matsune committed to a $2.5k budget for F&B and videographer, requested a speaking slot and demo booth for 4 Mixpanel team members. When the team proposed 1/21, Kara flagged a 30-day notice policy for hosting. Betty and Karsh attempted to negotiate flexibility but Kara confirmed Jan 21 was not feasible. Betty pivoted, securing an alternate January venue and proposing March 18 or 25 for Mixpanel. Betty also asked if the $2.5k commitment could still apply to January at the new venue. Kalina Bryant (Mixpanel) requested a formal proposal. Kara then reported drastic leadership changes at Mixpanel, pulling out of January entirely but confirming interest in March. Melissa took over coordination, explored date flexibility, and Kara confirmed April (excluding April 15 and May). Melissa confirmed Mixpanel as an April sponsor on Feb 3. Kara confirmed April on Feb 4. Melissa forwarded the thread internally with Karsh's sponsor proposal template, requesting someone draft the proposal.

Betty will run point to discuss what we need for the event: venue, F&B, and videographer. We can then determine what works for you and the Mixpanel team.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nKind regards,\nKarsh",

Our speaker generally has a great draw and we could be closer to 100 attendees. Though we will cap it based on the venue space\n- We typically have our events run from 6pm - 9pm. If there are security constraints (form for every attendee to fill out), please let us know.\n- Is there a preference on how Mixpanel would like to show up? We usually have a sponsor section for anyone from the sponsor to speak\n- We are always open to new ideas and have experimented with a dedicated table for demos as well\n- For the event's financial support, we would love to get support for the F&B and Video Recording. For our potential attendee size and our videographer cost is $500, we would propose a $2k budget. How does that sound?\n- Anything else you need from us to enable you for success?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nKind regards,\nKarsh"

I could ask for the first week of February, if that works for the team.\n\nAlso, yes people would need to fill out a form.

I'm swamped this week and next and would appreciate if someone can take the reins on this.\n\nThanks,\nMelissa\n\n===\n\nHere is what Karsh sent to another sponsor that we can leverage:\n\n- [Insert event topic/proposal/speaker - can all be considered \"tentative\" until we lock down speaker/topic]\n- The event will be targeted for the second half of April. Between Tuesday - Thursday. It would be from 5:30pm - 8:45pm (this includes volunteer time to come and support)\n- As we confirm the speaker's availability, are there any dates within this range that would be a no-go: [insert dates]\n- MixPanel's San Francisco office for the venue\n- Food & Beverage budget upto $1.5k. We typically get 50 to 80 people at our events but attendance depends on the speaker and marketing\n- A&V budget of $500. Warren is our A&V guy who records the event and then works with Mind the Product to post it\n- During the event itself:\n  - Demo booth for folks before and after the event to learn about Spark\n  - Someone from MixPanel to speak about the company/product during the sponsorship section (a dedicated time slot at the beginning of the event)"
