	Sponsorship and speaking inquiry from Atono reaching out through Betty, then handed off to Melissa. Natalia Urena proposes their Head of Product Doug as a full-session speaker rather than a typical sponsor slot. Melissa expresses interest and requests they fill out the speaker form. Thread currently awaits Atono’s form submission.
summary: |
	We Betty Margulies received a sponsorship inquiry from Natalia Urena at Atono on January 13, 2026, proposing a collaboration that would go beyond the typical two-minute sponsor slot. Natalia specifically requested a full speaking session for Doug, Atono’s Head of Product with 30 years of experience, to deliver practical product management insights. Betty responded on January 21 while at a company offsite, looping in co-organizers Karsh, Jerry, Melissa, and Wesley, and asking Melissa or Karsh to lead on the speaking opportunity. Natalia followed up on January 22 acknowledging Betty’s response. Melissa reached out on January 24 requesting availability for a call. Natalia responded on February 3 apologizing for the delay and providing her calendar link. Melissa replied on February 4 confirming she would book time and requesting that Atono fill out the ProductTank SF speaker form, providing links to recent event examples from January and February 2026. Thread currently awaits Atono’s form submission and scheduled call.
