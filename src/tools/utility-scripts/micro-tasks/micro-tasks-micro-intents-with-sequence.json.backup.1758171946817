IMPROVEMENT: Automated script with CLI interface that validates, fixes, and generates citations following established anchor patterns (caret syntax for requirements/stories, emphasis-marked for components, URL-encoded cross-document links). Architecture must integrate with existing ES module agentic-workflows project and support all four specified functions: validation, AST parsing, link creation, and anchor generation."
